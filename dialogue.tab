bankGo_7b4b02d4	syc	Huh, sorry?	game/bank.rpy	72	syc "[what]"
bankGo_6fcd2e63	zg	You were daydreaming.	game/bank.rpy	73	zg "[what]"
bankGo_0de19ba7	zg	I said the man who killed your father turned himself in.	game/bank.rpy	74	zg "[what]"
bankGo_db07c8e2	zg	His name is Dan Scagnelli.	game/bank.rpy	75	zg "[what]"
bankGo_3bc9d16f	zg	If you want to, we can take you to the station to talk to him.	game/bank.rpy	76	zg "[what]"
bankGo_a2e33385	syc	Detective... did he say why?	game/bank.rpy	77	syc "[what]"
bankGo_a00413b3	zg	Why?	game/bank.rpy	78	zg "[what]"
bankGo_26af3138	syc	Why he did it... why he killed my dad.	game/bank.rpy	79	syc "[what]"
bankGo_5bd3ce97	zg	Dan Scagnelli is a hitman.	game/bank.rpy	80	zg "[what]"
bankGo_6f4701cb	zg	He probably got the order to do it from somebody.	game/bank.rpy	81	zg "[what]"
bankGo_d33955cc	zg	The business doesn't exactly involve signing contracts for obvious reasons, but...	game/bank.rpy	82	zg "[what]"
bankGo_188a55fa	zg	He probably agreed to not reveal his employer if arrested.	game/bank.rpy	83	zg "[what]"
bankGo_ba2a2ee9	zg	With the understanding they'd get him killed if he was.	game/bank.rpy	84	zg "[what]"
bankGo_9a4a61c2	zg	That's partially why we wanted to bring you to him.	game/bank.rpy	85	zg "[what]"

bankGo_52aa8a4d	zg	What do you mean?	game/bank.rpy	91	zg "[what]"
bankGo_fbc45b76	zg	Surely bringing a criminal to justice is worth it?	game/bank.rpy	92	zg "[what]"
bankGo_cf6cc37f_1	syc	...	game/bank.rpy	93	syc "[what]"
bankGo_31dde0e0	zg	Please, tell me what you mean.	game/bank.rpy	94	zg "[what]"
bankGo_4720e373	syci	Dad tried already.	game/bank.rpy	95	syci "[what]"
bankGo_eb1d5a0c	syci	It was one of the last things he told me before he died.	game/bank.rpy	96	syci "[what]"
bankGo_69228b07	syci	The justice system is broken.	game/bank.rpy	97	syci "[what]"
bankGo_1b79cb98	syci	It fails to indict criminals and arrests the innocent.	game/bank.rpy	98	syci "[what]"
bankGo_3cde5b49	syci	The criminals it does catch, it lets go far too soon.	game/bank.rpy	99	syci "[what]"
bankGo_7b6de9cc	syci	The only way to stop evil... is to eliminate it outside the justice system.	game/bank.rpy	100	syci "[what]"
bankGo_0f3f279f	blank	In the present...	game/bank.rpy	103	blank "[what]"
bankGo_7a9f2938	bi	Two more people dead...	game/bank.rpy	107	bi "[what]"
bankGo_1e0ac348	bi	Shahar... and Dracula.	game/bank.rpy	108	bi "[what]"
bankGo_4b5eaef2	bi	No, not Dracula. Ivan.	game/bank.rpy	109	bi "[what]"
bankGo_5e0c7398	bi	Even after his death he deserves to be called his real name.	game/bank.rpy	110	bi "[what]"
bankGo_4ab4233c	bi	Do I hate him? I think so.	game/bank.rpy	111	bi "[what]"
bankGo_6a60e4ae	bi	I think I have to.	game/bank.rpy	112	bi "[what]"
bankGo_a3bac10f	bi	What he did to Shahar is horrible.	game/bank.rpy	113	bi "[what]"
bankGo_a26c11ef	bi	But...	game/bank.rpy	115	bi "[what]"
bankGo_7def8104	bi	None of us here have options, all we can do is keep pushing forward.	game/bank.rpy	116	bi "[what]"
bankGo_925d09c3	bi	I won't let them, or anyone else, die in vain.	game/bank.rpy	117	bi "[what]"
bankGo_ac2f74b9	bi	...	game/bank.rpy	118	bi "[what]"
bankGo_f9db72e8	bi	I can feel a hand on my shoulder.	game/bank.rpy	119	bi "[what]"
bankGo_401a558b	bi	Hmm?	game/bank.rpy	120	bi "[what]"
bankGo_26ce0382	i	Hey, wake up Bert.	game/bank.rpy	125	i "[what]"
bankGo_b3afe9eb	i	Help me get everyone else up.	game/bank.rpy	126	i "[what]"
bankGo_a3493aff	bi	Everyone else was still laying around on the floor.	game/bank.rpy	127	bi "[what]"
bankGo_40ff55fa	bi	I spent an extra moment looking around, thinking there'd be more people, but...	game/bank.rpy	128	bi "[what]"
bankGo_94fc465a	bi	This really is everyone now.	game/bank.rpy	129	bi "[what]"
bankGo_67842b7f	bi	Freddy, Jenny, Sid, Sam, Lauren, and myself.	game/bank.rpy	130	bi "[what]"
bankGo_733aac8c	b	Yeah, let's get them up.	game/bank.rpy	131	b "[what]"
bankGo_47b877b2	bi	One by one, we slowly woke everyone up.	game/bank.rpy	133	bi "[what]"
bankGo_0f9fbb75	s	You'd think waking up would stop it, but no.	game/bank.rpy	135	s "[what]"
bankGo_4568301b	s	This nightmare continues.	game/bank.rpy	136	s "[what]"
bankGo_3f9d2ae2	s	Tsk... what a disaster.	game/bank.rpy	137	s "[what]"
bankGo_bc8c8e0e	b	Is everyone okay?	game/bank.rpy	138	b "[what]"
bankGo_5978d513	l	Okay as I could be, I guess.	game/bank.rpy	143	l "[what]"
bankGo_2aa3237c	l	It looks like we've been moved again.	game/bank.rpy	144	l "[what]"
bankGo_07c1ed0a	b	As crazy as it sounds, I am starting to get used to it.	game/bank.rpy	145	b "[what]"
bankGo_9b5b064a	b	We can check in more detail, but it looks like the exits are boarded up again...	game/bank.rpy	146	b "[what]"
bankGo_58d2c33c	j	Freddy, are you alright? Do you still remember my name?	game/bank.rpy	155	j "[what]"
bankGo_48032cf9	f	You're still Jenny, right?	game/bank.rpy	156	f "[what]"
bankGo_47da00a2	j	Phew! Just checking!	game/bank.rpy	158	j "[what]"
bankGo_f4452749	f	Yay!	game/bank.rpy	159	f "[what]"
bankGo_b9d13187	j	It can't hurt to do a quick mental check every once in a while.	game/bank.rpy	161	j "[what]"
bankGo_29f62832	j	Besides, we are being knocked out by a chip in our brain.	game/bank.rpy	162	j "[what]"
bankGo_62219d2d	b	Yeah, I'm not exactly up to speed on the science behind that.	game/bank.rpy	163	b "[what]"
bankGo_455a6f7e	b	Hardly seems safe or reliable.	game/bank.rpy	164	b "[what]"
bankGo_03474d4c	b	At the very least, now we know that Ivan is the one that set them up.	game/bank.rpy	165	b "[what]"
bankGo_e9bc4944	b	I'd say it's hard to believe, but it's not like he was ever very open with us...	game/bank.rpy	166	b "[what]"
bankGo_93604454	i	That bastard did this to us...	game/bank.rpy	170	i "[what]"
bankGo_731b3bcb	i	Treating us like damn lab rats, it's disgusting!	game/bank.rpy	171	i "[what]"
bankGo_13aba047	b	You're right, but think about it from his point of view.	game/bank.rpy	172	b "[what]"
bankGo_84b01b35	i	H-huh?	game/bank.rpy	174	i "[what]"
bankGo_7d4de846	b	What options did he have?	game/bank.rpy	175	b "[what]"
bankGo_fe0532f7	b	If he hadn't done it, who knows what the Game Master would've done to him.	game/bank.rpy	176	b "[what]"
bankGo_6f3d4875	i	...	game/bank.rpy	177	i "[what]"
bankGo_52469e77	b	As horrible as what he did was, we'll never know the situation he was put in.	game/bank.rpy	178	b "[what]"
bankGo_854cdd47	j	At this point in this mess, it's not worth being mad at anyone.	game/bank.rpy	179	j "[what]"
bankGo_be13f73b	j	Plus, it's actually useful information!	game/bank.rpy	180	j "[what]"
bankGo_a5dbfb7b	j	We're slowly getting a more complete picture about why we're all here.	game/bank.rpy	182	j "[what]"
bankGo_52f9f415	b	You're right Jenny.	game/bank.rpy	183	b "[what]"
bankGo_e334da33	b	We know Sid, Shahar, Dracula, Stella, and Mr. Sydell are all connected via this one lawsuit.	game/bank.rpy	184	b "[what]"
bankGo_b9654157	b	Catherine robbed Mr. Sydell.	game/bank.rpy	185	b "[what]"
bankGo_45da66b2	b	And Sam has interacted with him before.	game/bank.rpy	186	b "[what]"
bankGo_a4efd32c	b	Though it's still not clear how Freddy, Jenny, Kaiser, Dan, Lauren, and I are connected...	game/bank.rpy	187	b "[what]"
bankGo_7f085917	b	That's a whole lot of us that have seemingly no connection to the rest...	game/bank.rpy	188	b "[what]"
bankGo_84ef991c	s	In any case...	game/bank.rpy	193	s "[what]"
bankGo_77715916	s	I think we should start to explore.	game/bank.rpy	194	s "[what]"
bankGo_9572e210	s	There's no point in waiting around and wasting time.	game/bank.rpy	195	s "[what]"
bankGo_1c28ae59	s	We need to know what we're dealing with here.	game/bank.rpy	196	s "[what]"
bankGo_6b533502	b	Agreed.	game/bank.rpy	197	b "[what]"
bankGo_b659cd8b	b	This room seems like... a lobby? For some type of business.	game/bank.rpy	198	b "[what]"
bankGo_d4b3eace	s	There looks like a floor-plan on the wall over there, behind the counter.	game/bank.rpy	199	s "[what]"
bankGo_962f6a8d	b	Oh wow, this is interesting!	game/bank.rpy	202	b "[what]"
bankGo_8df0c0d8	s	Why do you say?	game/bank.rpy	203	s "[what]"
bankGo_1a24cfa3	b	None of the other places we've been put have given us a map.	game/bank.rpy	204	b "[what]"
bankGo_f399405e	b	With this, we know what we're getting into, at least a little bit.	game/bank.rpy	205	b "[what]"
bankGo_74a5bff2	l	That star must indicate our current location.	game/bank.rpy	206	l "[what]"
bankGo_e6b24d7c	l	It says we're in the "lounge" right now, which makes sense.	game/bank.rpy	207	l "[what]"
bankGo_d2519227	i	Wait a minute, does that say... vault?	game/bank.rpy	208	i "[what]"
bankGo_696c2270	i	Like, a BANK VAULT?	game/bank.rpy	209	i "[what]"
bankGo_8b025b76	b	Yeah, I think we must be in a bank.	game/bank.rpy	210	b "[what]"
bankGo_f57eb978	b	I wonder why this is here in the first place.	game/bank.rpy	211	b "[what]"
bankGo_88824385	l	It's probably a safety thing? So the bank employees know where the exits are.	game/bank.rpy	212	l "[what]"
bankGo_17e30088	l	You know, like how schools have maps for evacuation in case of a fire.	game/bank.rpy	213	l "[what]"
bankGo_1b692f3f	b	Though as far as I can tell, there's only one exit...	game/bank.rpy	214	b "[what]"
bankGo_1f9d2b90	s	Maybe it was just put here for this... situation.	game/bank.rpy	215	s "[what]"
bankGo_81472fb2	i	So if I go out this door and down the hallway...	game/bank.rpy	218	i "[what]"
bankGo_4d09dabd	i	There's a bank vault?	game/bank.rpy	219	i "[what]"
bankGo_85aa562f	b	Uhhh, that is what this map says...	game/bank.rpy	220	b "[what]"
bankGo_ea76b6c7	i	That nobody's guarding, probably?	game/bank.rpy	221	i "[what]"
bankGo_40f8495a	b	But-	game/bank.rpy	222	b "[what]"
bankGo_aed30208	i	See ya!	game/bank.rpy	223	i "[what]"
bankGo_0fca2a65	bi	Sigh.	game/bank.rpy	226	bi "[what]"
bankGo_0f01e36e	bi	We should probably go after him.	game/bank.rpy	227	bi "[what]"
bankGo_c7bb1c43	j	Come on Freddy, let's follow Sid!	game/bank.rpy	233	j "[what]"
bankGo_7b4a923f	f	Yes ma'am!	game/bank.rpy	234	f "[what]"
bankGo_f3b89a53	b	Thanks for keeping a level head, Jenny.	game/bank.rpy	235	b "[what]"
bankGo_2d49653a	j	Yeah! We can't let him get all the money for himself!	game/bank.rpy	236	j "[what]"
bankGo_8b14a7c4	b	Or not...	game/bank.rpy	241	b "[what]"
bankGo_db1d216b	s	We'll need to come back to explore this room more in a bit.	game/bank.rpy	243	s "[what]"
bankGo_172bf6da	b	Agreed. We can circle back here at the end.	game/bank.rpy	244	b "[what]"
bankGo_d94c62ef	b	Plus, with all the couches, this seems like a good meeting and sleeping spot.	game/bank.rpy	245	b "[what]"
bankGo_0f57b688	l	Bit of a hectic start here.	game/bank.rpy	249	l "[what]"
bankGo_2777c9cb	b	At least everyone seems to be in decent spirits.	game/bank.rpy	250	b "[what]"
bankGo_2b7d81c8	l	Yeah!	game/bank.rpy	251	l "[what]"
bankGo_d1af895e	l	Maybe this is weird to say given the situation, but...	game/bank.rpy	252	l "[what]"
bankGo_e04c7d68	l	At least I feel like I can trust most of you.	game/bank.rpy	254	l "[what]"
bankGo_3bf003ad	b	Oh? What do you mean?	game/bank.rpy	255	b "[what]"
bankGo_3764bca4	l	No offense to some of our fallen comrades but...	game/bank.rpy	256	l "[what]"
bankGo_30a2a30c	l	It was really difficult to work with Stella, Dracula, or Shahar...	game/bank.rpy	258	l "[what]"
bankGo_4180e19a	l	Everyone in this core group is cooperative and pretty... normal?	game/bank.rpy	259	l "[what]"
bankGo_efd2309b	l	Well, Sid is normal when stuff like the safe isn't involved...	game/bank.rpy	260	l "[what]"
bankGo_13b58cf3	l	But other than Sam - who's seemingly turned a corner - I'm not scared of anyone here.	game/bank.rpy	261	l "[what]"
bankGo_8d649182	b	Yeah, you're right.	game/bank.rpy	262	b "[what]"
bankGo_1617e164	bi	She really is right - this group is pretty trustwrothy.	game/bank.rpy	265	bi "[what]"
bankGo_aa13f09c	bi	I've tried my best to cooperate with everyone this whole time, but...	game/bank.rpy	266	bi "[what]"
bankGo_3a6cbadd	bi	It seems like now it will actually be a bit easier.	game/bank.rpy	267	bi "[what]"
bankGo_d18fb5aa	bi	The only issue is, that makes it even harder to pick out the Game Master...	game/bank.rpy	268	bi "[what]"
bankGo_c8008394	bi	If I feel like I can trust everyone, maybe I'm even further away from figuring out that mystery.	game/bank.rpy	269	bi "[what]"
bankGo_c1f0c951	bi	Maybe I shouldn't focus on the negatives.	game/bank.rpy	270	bi "[what]"
bankGo_0ac95245	b	You ready to go follow them?	game/bank.rpy	272	b "[what]"
bankGo_24bf79d6	l	Let's do it. They're probably already in the next room.	game/bank.rpy	273	l "[what]"
bankGo_5681a636	l	I hear them chatting in that next room on the left.	game/bank.rpy	281	l "[what]"
bankGo_16a92285	b	Hmm, Lauren? Do you see that too?	game/bank.rpy	282	b "[what]"
bankGo_148abd31	l	See what?	game/bank.rpy	283	l "[what]"
bankGo_0c4ac54a	b	There's a red light coming from further down the hallway.	game/bank.rpy	284	b "[what]"
bankGo_7266bc00	b	It must be really bright if we can see it around the corner.	game/bank.rpy	285	b "[what]"
bankGo_620fbb98	l	Huh, you're right.	game/bank.rpy	286	l "[what]"
bankGo_ce970558	b	Well, we'll do a full tour anyway, might as well go in order.	game/bank.rpy	287	b "[what]"
bankGo_d82c13f8	b	If the map was accurate, this next room should be...	game/bank.rpy	288	b "[what]"
bankGo_6824f06b	l	...the kitchen.	game/bank.rpy	293	l "[what]"
bankGo_e52c3b83	j	This room's about what I'd expect.	game/bank.rpy	299	j "[what]"
bankGo_525d23c8	j	A sink, coffee machine, and a fridge with some snacks.	game/bank.rpy	300	j "[what]"
bankGo_335d0b78	b	I could go for some coffee and snacks right about now...	game/bank.rpy	301	b "[what]"
bankGo_4b23384f	j	Well, there is some.	game/bank.rpy	302	j "[what]"
bankGo_96a1356c	b	Hm... but it might be like the train where it only will last us a few days...	game/bank.rpy	303	b "[what]"
bankGo_6ac5c48f	b	We just "woke up" so maybe not now.	game/bank.rpy	304	b "[what]"
bankGo_a38d62b3	b	That poster on the wall seems like it's mocking us...	game/bank.rpy	308	b "[what]"
bankGo_becd80df	ses	Mrow...	game/bank.rpy	309	ses "[what]"
bankGo_f2682043	l	The Game Master has some sick sense of humor.	game/bank.rpy	310	l "[what]"
bankGo_7b149fb8	j	Aww, really? I think it's cute!	game/bank.rpy	312	j "[what]"
bankGo_22262261	j	It's your cousin, Sesame!	game/bank.rpy	313	j "[what]"
bankGo_587c83be	ses	Hssssss	game/bank.rpy	314	ses "[what]"
bankGo_6c193098	b	He seems... a bit combative towards the cartoon cat.	game/bank.rpy	315	b "[what]"
bankGo_1fa01bb6	l	Anyway, having access to food is nice.	game/bank.rpy	316	l "[what]"
bankGo_ced2189d	l	Maybe not a nutritious meal, but I'll see if I can grab something for Freddy.	game/bank.rpy	317	l "[what]"
bankGo_57fc2493	j	Pretty dinky kitchen for how fancy the lobby was, huh?	game/bank.rpy	321	j "[what]"
bankGo_681a22ac	j	I guess it doesn't have to look pretty if the customers don't come in here.	game/bank.rpy	322	j "[what]"
bankGo_231c5a1e	b	The boss here probably doesn't want the workers spending too much time here...	game/bank.rpy	323	b "[what]"
bankGo_829ce2df	b	Regardless, any place with food is good enough for me.	game/bank.rpy	324	b "[what]"
bankGo_a2ae2784	b	Still, I can't help but wonder...	game/bank.rpy	325	b "[what]"
bankGo_a39d8df5	b	Why a bank? Why did the Game Master bring us here?	game/bank.rpy	326	b "[what]"
bankGo_61bb6c3f	j	What do you mean?	game/bank.rpy	327	j "[what]"
bankGo_5691e7c6	b	Well, so far, we've been brought to places that are significant to one of us.	game/bank.rpy	328	b "[what]"
bankGo_e9f66c7b	b	Kaiser's train heist, Catherine's burglary...	game/bank.rpy	329	b "[what]"
bankGo_16836afe	b	If feels like the implication is... that one of us has robbed this bank.	game/bank.rpy	330	b "[what]"
bankGo_1df4f91e	j	Huh?!	game/bank.rpy	331	j "[what]"
bankGo_05f467d7	j	No way! Nobody here is capable of that.	game/bank.rpy	332	j "[what]"
bankGo_476ecdfd	b	I'd agree, if it wasn't for the circumstances...	game/bank.rpy	333	b "[what]"
bankGo_2a829b56	b	But that's definitely my first impression.	game/bank.rpy	334	b "[what]"
bankGo_d2bc44c2	j	Hmmm, I'm not sold.	game/bank.rpy	336	j "[what]"
bankGo_4efb35c2	j	There's probably a more reasonable explanation than robbery.	game/bank.rpy	337	j "[what]"
bankGo_ea24f45c	j	Maybe someone just... stole some of the snacks from the break room!	game/bank.rpy	338	j "[what]"
bankGo_a57403ea	j	That's a crime too, ya know!	game/bank.rpy	339	j "[what]"
bankGo_b6089c1e	bi	Jenny might be right, I don't think anyone here could have robbed a bank.	game/bank.rpy	343	bi "[what]"
bankGo_fb3338eb	bi	Well, except for one person...	game/bank.rpy	344	bi "[what]"
bankGo_05d8ab55	bi	Sid. Just the thought of money turns him into another person.	game/bank.rpy	345	bi "[what]"
bankGo_12777461	bi	But if he's robbed this bank before, why is he so excited?	game/bank.rpy	346	bi "[what]"
bankGo_20fb71f7	bi	Is it just bad acting?	game/bank.rpy	347	bi "[what]"
bankGo_cb0dc470	bi	But I also wouldn't have thought the others were capable of what they did...	game/bank.rpy	348	bi "[what]"
bankGo_cc67f067	bi	Plus, we already know Sid was in a tough financial situation, so...	game/bank.rpy	349	bi "[what]"
bankGo_c65c76dd	bi	Thinking he did something extreme isn't out of the question.	game/bank.rpy	350	bi "[what]"
bankGo_a07d5602	bi	It's worth remembering.	game/bank.rpy	351	bi "[what]"
bankGo_7bc3da9b	bi	Speaking of Sid...	game/bank.rpy	352	bi "[what]"
bankGo_ee754a4b	b	Hey wait a minute, where's Sid?	game/bank.rpy	359	b "[what]"
bankGo_c5ec31f2	l	Freddy said he ran ahead when everyone else came in here.	game/bank.rpy	360	l "[what]"
bankGo_8aab85d8	f	Yup! He kept saying "money money money money money" and left us behind.	game/bank.rpy	361	f "[what]"
bankGo_04c3b2cc	b	We should really be sticking together...	game/bank.rpy	362	b "[what]"
bankGo_72a5abcd	b	I'm gonna go look for him.	game/bank.rpy	363	b "[what]"
bankGo_8ca47fef	l	We'll stay here for a bit and check out all these cabinets.	game/bank.rpy	364	l "[what]"
bankGo_e64b2d86	f	And snacks!	game/bank.rpy	365	f "[what]"
bankGo_e4e1f504	bi	Hey, that's normally my job...	game/bank.rpy	366	bi "[what]"
bankGo_950f29bc	s	I'll come with you.	game/bank.rpy	371	s "[what]"
bankGo_e8b5c6ff	b	Okay, gre- hey wait, what?	game/bank.rpy	372	b "[what]"
bankGo_286761ee	s	What's wrong?	game/bank.rpy	373	s "[what]"
bankGo_8f0984c1	b	I think this is the first time you've actively tried to spend time with me.	game/bank.rpy	374	b "[what]"
bankGo_e1554201	s	...	game/bank.rpy	376	s "[what]"
bankGo_193cc039	s	I spent some time thinking about what Lauren said to me at the hospital.	game/bank.rpy	377	s "[what]"
bankGo_9fbb0f3f	s	I think after everything, the least I can do is try to be helpful.	game/bank.rpy	378	s "[what]"
bankGo_c45467b3	b	I... appreciate that.	game/bank.rpy	379	b "[what]"
bankGo_7f2bf68e	b	We all do.	game/bank.rpy	380	b "[what]"
bankGo_9a401946	b	You know, we still trust you.	game/bank.rpy	381	b "[what]"
bankGo_e8e955f1	b	We understand that you just did what you thought you had to do.	game/bank.rpy	382	b "[what]"
bankGo_3f315b09	s	Yeah, yeah, whatever. Let's just go find Sid.	game/bank.rpy	383	s "[what]"
bankGo_4debbc0d	bi	Well, progress.	game/bank.rpy	385	bi "[what]"
bankGo_08e19c40	bi	We walked out into the hallway and heard Sid's voice.	game/bank.rpy	387	bi "[what]"
bankGo_7694bced	bi	Following it led us to...	game/bank.rpy	388	bi "[what]"
bank2_88dee4fa	b	Sid?...	game/bank.rpy	394	b "[what]"
bank2_fcce28ca	b	Woah... this vault is massive.	game/bank.rpy	395	b "[what]"
bank2_cb59f266	b	That door looks like a foot thick of solid steel.	game/bank.rpy	396	b "[what]"
bank2_5bfcd674	b	It must weigh at least a ton.	game/bank.rpy	397	b "[what]"
bank2_cfaa258e	i	MY vault!	game/bank.rpy	398	i "[what]"
bank2_933239aa	i	HEY! Back off, this is gunna be MY MONEY!	game/bank.rpy	403	i "[what]"
bank2_68d710df	i	I've got sharp teeth and I WILL bite you!	game/bank.rpy	404	i "[what]"
bank2_69597ced	b	Whoa, Sid, it's just us!	game/bank.rpy	405	b "[what]"
bank2_656e546f	s	What are you talking about?	game/bank.rpy	406	s "[what]"
bank2_b569e5c0	i	S-sorry for snapping at you...	game/bank.rpy	408	i "[what]"
bank2_ba1c6c3f	i	I'm just kinda frustrated...	game/bank.rpy	409	i "[what]"
bank2_6cb71f07	s	Frustrated?	game/bank.rpy	410	s "[what]"
bank2_55f587f2	i	Well, I was hoping I'd find the vault and grab all the money, easy peasy.	game/bank.rpy	411	i "[what]"
bank2_23e360eb	i	But, well, look for yourself.	game/bank.rpy	412	i "[what]"
bank2_a7dd2983	bi	There's a poster on the wall next to the vault.	game/bank.rpy	416	bi "[what]"
bank2_55c56323	b	Huh? What's it say...	game/bank.rpy	418	b "[what]"
bank2_a91cc5c6	b	"Each of you possesses one third of the bank vault passcode..."	game/bank.rpy	419	b "[what]"
bank2_908d7a89	b	"The day of the month you were born on."	game/bank.rpy	420	b "[what]"
bank2_83fef532	bi	!!!	game/bank.rpy	421	bi "[what]"
bank2_34bc1ed7	b	"Use any three of your birthdates, in any order, to unlock the safe."	game/bank.rpy	422	b "[what]"
bank2_17b9968f	b	Seems easy enough...	game/bank.rpy	423	b "[what]"
bank2_bef3b011	b	"The vault contains not only a substantial fortune, but also the true secrets of this game."	game/bank.rpy	424	b "[what]"
bank2_8c0b3e72	b	This seems almost too good to be true?	game/bank.rpy	425	b "[what]"
bank2_74a12f89	b	We can finally get answers, and apparently a ton of money?	game/bank.rpy	426	b "[what]"
bank2_4c017119	i	Well...	game/bank.rpy	427	i "[what]"
bank2_ecda5e64	b	Oh, there's some fine print.	game/bank.rpy	428	b "[what]"
bank2_80708f21	b	Let's see...	game/bank.rpy	429	b "[what]"
bank2_324436db	b	......	game/bank.rpy	432	b "[what]"
bank2_3b5a5dc0	b	"Inputting an incorrect passcode will instantly kill the user."	game/bank.rpy	433	b "[what]"
bank2_06c8fae4	b	Oh.	game/bank.rpy	434	b "[what]"
bank2_92e76d13	b	Now I see the frustration...	game/bank.rpy	435	b "[what]"
bank2_d478a7c1	i	I mean, it's a little scary, but all we need is three people's birthdays!	game/bank.rpy	440	i "[what]"
bank2_dbc50fa3	i	The three of us could crack this bad boy open right now!	game/bank.rpy	441	i "[what]"
bank2_55fa8b6c	s	It's not that simple...	game/bank.rpy	442	s "[what]"
bank2_f4229519	s	How can I trust you to give me your correct birthdate?	game/bank.rpy	443	s "[what]"
bank2_27e0c25b	s	How can you trust me to give you mine?	game/bank.rpy	444	s "[what]"
bank2_c6ae1126	b	If someone lied, the user would die...	game/bank.rpy	445	b "[what]"
bank2_dae5b0a2	s	Yeah, and we wouldn't know who the killer is.	game/bank.rpy	446	s "[what]"
bank2_1043e735	b	Huh?	game/bank.rpy	447	b "[what]"
bank2_1a35a126	s	Since you need three numbers, there are two people who could've lied about their number.	game/bank.rpy	448	s "[what]"
bank2_9b5bcbf3	s	So if someone died inputting the wrong code, we would have no way to know who lied.	game/bank.rpy	449	s "[what]"
bank2_8a9fece5	b	Well, if we knew whose three birthdays were used, we'd have a 50/50 shot, right?	game/bank.rpy	450	b "[what]"
bank2_cdf2842d	s	Yeah, but with six of us left...	game/bank.rpy	451	s "[what]"
bank2_5dccfbc6	s	Well, five after a murder.	game/bank.rpy	452	s "[what]"
bank2_09650183	s	50/50 isn't that much of an improvement over random guessing.	game/bank.rpy	453	s "[what]"
bank2_28dc1bca	s	Hell, given our track record of solving these murders...	game/bank.rpy	454	s "[what]"
bank2_e961a149	s	50/50 is better odds for the murderer than any other setup.	game/bank.rpy	455	s "[what]"
bank2_66b16957	b	It seems like the perfect setup to kill Sid, huh...	game/bank.rpy	456	b "[what]"
bank2_eb1296de	i	Hey! I-I knew all that...	game/bank.rpy	457	i "[what]"
bank2_284e8fc9	i	Maybe...	game/bank.rpy	458	i "[what]"
bank2_a67b2375	s	To top it all off, we don't even know if it's true.	game/bank.rpy	459	s "[what]"
bank2_0e8a1dbe	b	Yeah, it could just be a trick, an empty promise to get us to kill each other.	game/bank.rpy	460	b "[what]"
bank2_a67513dd	b	For all we know, successfully opening the safe instantly kills ALL of us.	game/bank.rpy	461	b "[what]"
bank2_9a319301	s	What a mess...	game/bank.rpy	462	s "[what]"
bank2_c5e500a5	i	Ummm... maybe we could... guess?	game/bank.rpy	463	i "[what]"
bank2_a8d47db0	i	The poster says all of us have a code, and we can use any three in any order.	game/bank.rpy	464	i "[what]"
bank2_4ff01629	i	Let's see, carry the two... multiply this by that... oh wait...	game/bank.rpy	465	i "[what]"
bank2_f9382c58	b	There are only six of us, which means there are... 120 correct passcodes.	game/bank.rpy	466	b "[what]"
bank2_140dafca	i	47! Uh, I mean, 120!	game/bank.rpy	467	i "[what]"
bank2_f1ca28d8	b	And that's assuming we all have different birthdates.	game/bank.rpy	468	b "[what]"
bank2_198431a3	i	That seems like a bunch, right?	game/bank.rpy	469	i "[what]"
bank2_dd00ad22	i	Most locks only have one correct combo, 120 is a lot of options!	game/bank.rpy	470	i "[what]"
bank2_dd4baf2f	b	There are 31 days in a month though, and you'd have to guess two numbers, so...	game/bank.rpy	471	b "[what]"
bank2_8a16d8fa	i	Two? The safe needs three numbers!	game/bank.rpy	472	i "[what]"
bank2_eed9e312	s	Yeah but you know your own birthday, right?	game/bank.rpy	473	s "[what]"
bank2_ac58467d	s	...Right?	game/bank.rpy	474	s "[what]"
bank2_9b2712c9	i	Oh, yes! So you'd only have to guess two numbers!	game/bank.rpy	475	i "[what]"
bank2_a05315df	b	In total, your odds are 20/961 to guess correctly if I'm doing the math right.	game/bank.rpy	476	b "[what]"
bank2_3ad0bd51	i	WHAT?! Are you sure?!	game/bank.rpy	477	i "[what]"
bank2_f69b916b	i	Math is so lame dude...	game/bank.rpy	478	i "[what]"
bank2_0568e2aa	s	Sid, did you have a locker in school?	game/bank.rpy	479	s "[what]"
bank2_fd0b43a0	i	Yeah! That's where I hid my... um, my homework.	game/bank.rpy	480	i "[what]"
bank2_fcf6bdab	s	I take it you've never messed up the locker combo before?	game/bank.rpy	481	s "[what]"
bank2_e4a78be1	i	What? Everyone messes it up sometimes... I always scroll past the second number on accident.	game/bank.rpy	482	i "[what]"
bank2_6b3e2cbc	i	...Oh.	game/bank.rpy	483	i "[what]"
bank2_a4cc01e8	s	Yeah, would be a real shame if you messed up this locker combo.	game/bank.rpy	484	s "[what]"
bank2_b7ccdb41	i	So what do we do, just ignore it?	game/bank.rpy	485	i "[what]"
bank2_a1e9933b	b	It can be our last resort.	game/bank.rpy	486	b "[what]"
bank2_51bbfe4b	b	If we go a few days with no other progress, maybe we can try it.	game/bank.rpy	487	b "[what]"
bank2_91a5e844	s	Even then it seems risky... Unless Sid is the one opening it.	game/bank.rpy	488	s "[what]"
bank2_349ae98c	i	Hey! What's that supposed to mean?!	game/bank.rpy	490	i "[what]"
bank2_81079405	b	Sid, if you see the others before Sam or I do, tell them what we talked about.	game/bank.rpy	491	b "[what]"
bank2_ac7849bc	i	Yeah, yeah. Not opening the safe unless it's our last resort.	game/bank.rpy	493	i "[what]"
bank2_8f4e3764	i	I think I'll look around in case there's a master key or something.	game/bank.rpy	494	i "[what]"
bank2_ea8c1349	b	Good idea.	game/bank.rpy	495	b "[what]"
bank2_9136584a	i	Oh, also, what's up with all these lights on the walls?	game/bank.rpy	496	i "[what]"
bank2_41a5c6e4	i	There's this red light around all four walls of the vault.	game/bank.rpy	497	i "[what]"
bank2_2e02f4cd	b	We noticed that too.	game/bank.rpy	498	b "[what]"
bank2_b0124da0	i	It could just be for the vibe?	game/bank.rpy	499	i "[what]"
bank2_2e1b456b	s	Right, the same people who made that grungy kitchen want to decorate the bank.	game/bank.rpy	500	s "[what]"
bank2_9c81ee92	b	I agree, it's probably for function over form somehow.	game/bank.rpy	501	b "[what]"
bank2_35a8f48e	b	Maybe it's a way to show the vault is locked?	game/bank.rpy	502	b "[what]"
bank2_87239062	i	Oh, maybe it's in case the lights go off!	game/bank.rpy	503	i "[what]"
bank2_0fb2ca75	i	Like those lights on planes!	game/bank.rpy	504	i "[what]"
bank2_cd376026	s	How do you know planes have lights?	game/bank.rpy	505	s "[what]"
bank2_0bd445db	i	Hey, my family wasn't always poor...	game/bank.rpy	506	i "[what]"
bank2_5446ca14	b	C'mon, focus.	game/bank.rpy	507	b "[what]"
bank2_b83286af	b	Maybe it's an indicator that the security system is armed?	game/bank.rpy	508	b "[what]"
bank2_c06d87ed	b	That would make it easier for workers to know the status of the vault, from any side.	game/bank.rpy	509	b "[what]"
bank2_de57f708	s	Maybe the lights would turn off if we managed to get into the vault?	game/bank.rpy	510	s "[what]"
bank2_885ee868	b	We should keep it in mind.	game/bank.rpy	511	b "[what]"
bank2_d24ea68c	b	Let's keep exploring, Sam.	game/bank.rpy	512	b "[what]"
bank2_3553a0c1	b	Sid, don't touch the safe!	game/bank.rpy	513	b "[what]"
bank2_6f3d4875	i	...	game/bank.rpy	514	i "[what]"
bank2_547b6a27	s	Punk...	game/bank.rpy	515	s "[what]"
bank2_5aafa918	bi	We walked back to an entrance we passed while trying to find Sid...	game/bank.rpy	518	bi "[what]"
bank3_f4cbe8ea	b	So according to the map in the lobby, this should be... the director's office.	game/bank.rpy	525	b "[what]"
bank3_1ca8c672	s	What's a bank director anyway?	game/bank.rpy	527	s "[what]"
bank3_6fac4d2c	b	I have no idea.	game/bank.rpy	528	b "[what]"
bank3_1d84c456	b	Not like I've ever worked at a bank before...	game/bank.rpy	529	b "[what]"
bank3_855344d9	s	Sounds like something the murderer would say.	game/bank.rpy	530	s "[what]"
bank3_3732494a	b	Har har.	game/bank.rpy	531	b "[what]"
bank3_576d97a1	b	Seriously though, let's look around, maybe we can find out more about this place.	game/bank.rpy	532	b "[what]"
bank3_b0813fde	s	You'd think there would be a computer in here...	game/bank.rpy	533	s "[what]"
bank3_36b50a2c	b	It looks like there was one on the desk.	game/bank.rpy	534	b "[what]"
bank3_f4e03e2d	b	I can see the marks where a monitor and a mousepad must have been.	game/bank.rpy	535	b "[what]"
bank3_23592485	b	Surely most banking stuff is done electronically rather than with paper these days?	game/bank.rpy	536	b "[what]"
bank3_4704a0dd	s	If their business was anything like mine...	game/bank.rpy	537	s "[what]"
bank3_884a705d	s	They probably had some stuff they didn't want a permanent record of.	game/bank.rpy	538	s "[what]"
bank3_87b60715	bi	Right. I keep forgetting Sam dealt drugs once.	game/bank.rpy	539	bi "[what]"
bank3_b1e77b4c	s	There is a filing cabinet over there, though.	game/bank.rpy	540	s "[what]"
bank3_7d908049	bi	Sam took a peek in the filing cabinet.	game/bank.rpy	542	bi "[what]"
bank3_88b78709	s	Damn, there are a ton of records in here.	game/bank.rpy	544	s "[what]"
bank3_d766e54e	s	Family records, transaction history, mortgage info...	game/bank.rpy	545	s "[what]"
bank3_e9e5da33	s	You said Shahar's name showed up in the hospital's computer, right?	game/bank.rpy	546	s "[what]"
bank3_6fc80148	b	Yeah.	game/bank.rpy	547	b "[what]"
bank3_d904d910	s	Maybe there's some dirt on someone else in here.	game/bank.rpy	548	s "[what]"
bank3_7b3c1afe	s	It's worth looking.	game/bank.rpy	549	s "[what]"
bank3_f1f18393	j	Hey, I caught up with you guys.	game/bank.rpy	556	j "[what]"
bank3_877ade25	j	Anything fun I missed?	game/bank.rpy	557	j "[what]"
bank3_852bf62c	bi	I quickly got Jenny up to speed on the bank vault.	game/bank.rpy	558	bi "[what]"
bank3_182c3d43	j	That's terrifying! Maybe we can have Sid enter the passcode.	game/bank.rpy	559	j "[what]"
bank3_7941c059	s	That's what I said too.	game/bank.rpy	560	s "[what]"
bank3_6e4705bf	b	We've agreed not to touch it unless we can't make progress otherwise.	game/bank.rpy	561	b "[what]"
bank3_99aed1ae	j	Gotcha!	game/bank.rpy	562	j "[what]"
bank3_4f524dd5	b	Anyway, digging through these filing cabinets could be useful.	game/bank.rpy	563	b "[what]"
bank3_08d9d062	b	Sounds incredibly tedious though.	game/bank.rpy	564	b "[what]"
bank3_4538a463	j	Oh no... paperwork.	game/bank.rpy	565	j "[what]"
bank3_be6cd78f	s	You two can go on ahead.	game/bank.rpy	566	s "[what]"
bank3_756a500f	s	I'll sift through this stuff.	game/bank.rpy	567	s "[what]"
bank3_1d418181	b	You sure?	game/bank.rpy	568	b "[what]"
bank3_d87ad68e	s	Yeah, if there's anything important I'll let everyone know.	game/bank.rpy	569	s "[what]"
bank3_9cf6eeb3	j	Shouldn't two of us go through it?	game/bank.rpy	570	j "[what]"
bank3_4f4bc706	j	Dracula deleted some crucial info about Shahar in the hospital...	game/bank.rpy	571	j "[what]"
bank3_5239e18e	s	Do you want to dig through the cabinet with me?	game/bank.rpy	572	s "[what]"
bank3_b4fa3fc0	j	...	game/bank.rpy	573	j "[what]"
bank3_d466cebf	j	You know what, I think I trust Sam!	game/bank.rpy	574	j "[what]"
bank3_422cc5e4	s	Yeah, figured as much.	game/bank.rpy	575	s "[what]"
bank3_b9e8a6c4	b	Thanks Sam.	game/bank.rpy	576	b "[what]"
bank3_08127bc4	s	Yeah, if you don't see me in a few hours make sure I haven't fallen asleep.	game/bank.rpy	577	s "[what]"
bank3_4b3e3184	s	It's gonna take hours to get through this...	game/bank.rpy	578	s "[what]"
bank3_8f14eb1c	b	I agree, but if it can help us get out of here alive, it's worth it.	game/bank.rpy	579	b "[what]"
bank3_a109ae23	s	Yeah. I guess we'll see.	game/bank.rpy	580	s "[what]"
bank3_c8cd9c33	j	There should be one more room we can get into at the end of this hallway.	game/bank.rpy	581	j "[what]"
bank3_e41a06df	j	Come on Bert, let's go check it out.	game/bank.rpy	582	j "[what]"
bank3_529af2eb	b	Alright.	game/bank.rpy	583	b "[what]"
bank3_3cc46fef	b	A staff locker room, huh.	game/bank.rpy	591	b "[what]"
bank3_3f286bd0	j	It reminds me of the ones at a gym.	game/bank.rpy	592	j "[what]"
bank3_2bdfac98	j	There's even sections over there for men's and women's showers.	game/bank.rpy	593	j "[what]"
bank3_edfce1eb	j	Why does a bank need a locker room with full sized communal showers?	game/bank.rpy	594	j "[what]"
bank3_be3830b1	b	Yeah, it's a bit odd.	game/bank.rpy	595	b "[what]"
bank3_c21db386	j	Also, there are tons of lockers with keys in the locks.	game/bank.rpy	596	j "[what]"
bank3_9c6c175f	b	Maybe this building used to be a gym and they repurposed it?	game/bank.rpy	597	b "[what]"
bank3_82018358	b	And they just used a "first come, first served" situation to grab any locker you want.	game/bank.rpy	598	b "[what]"
bank3_8c364829	j	I'm a bit worried about people coming here to hide stuff in a locker...	game/bank.rpy	599	j "[what]"
bank3_6e03ddc6	j	Maybe we should take out all the keys and put them somewhere?	game/bank.rpy	600	j "[what]"
bank3_9601e3e9	b	That's a good idea.	game/bank.rpy	601	b "[what]"
bank3_d88780e6	bi	Jenny grabbed all 16 locker keys.	game/bank.rpy	603	bi "[what]"
bank3_b425d6cd	j	Bert! Look at this.	game/bank.rpy	606	j "[what]"
bank3_3f0c695c	bi	She held up a grey worksuit.	game/bank.rpy	607	bi "[what]"
bank3_7e515c4b	b	Huh? What is that?	game/bank.rpy	608	b "[what]"
bank3_5d2cc55f	j	It looks like there's one in each locker.	game/bank.rpy	609	j "[what]"
bank3_65189182	j	They must be the security guards' uniforms.	game/bank.rpy	610	j "[what]"
bank3_a9a19630	b	They definitely don't look like something you'd want a customer to see.	game/bank.rpy	611	b "[what]"
bank3_9395c985	j	Yeah, way too tacky.	game/bank.rpy	612	j "[what]"
bank3_d0bd5290	b	No no, I mean like, they're not professional looking.	game/bank.rpy	613	b "[what]"
bank3_c7e1f86a	b	Very utiliarian design.	game/bank.rpy	614	b "[what]"
bank3_c38f58c9	b	The fact that the bank has 16 of these must mean they used them a lot...	game/bank.rpy	615	b "[what]"
bank3_5bcc04a7	j	Or they just had a lot of guards on payroll.	game/bank.rpy	616	j "[what]"
bank3_83126297	b	True...	game/bank.rpy	617	b "[what]"
bank3_fd461384	j	Well, they don't seem very useful for us, so I'll put this one back.	game/bank.rpy	618	j "[what]"
bank3_80bc5530	j	Anyway, do you want to hold onto these locker keys?	game/bank.rpy	619	j "[what]"
bank3_799aefbe	j	My skirt doesn't have any pockets.	game/bank.rpy	620	j "[what]"
bank3_7aaaad53	b	Me? I guess I could, but are you sure you can trust me?	game/bank.rpy	621	b "[what]"
bank3_8387e858	j	More than anyone else here.	game/bank.rpy	622	j "[what]"
bank3_1c68a0e2	j	Here you go!	game/bank.rpy	623	j "[what]"
bank3_355d4a98	bi	I'll keep these in my backpack...	game/bank.rpy	624	bi "[what]"
bank3_ac2f74b9	bi	...	game/bank.rpy	625	bi "[what]"
bank3_3681440b	b	Alright, now hopefully no one asks what's in here.	game/bank.rpy	626	b "[what]"
bank3_5942b72b	b	Looking around, we've got showers, towels, lockers, you name it.	game/bank.rpy	627	b "[what]"
bank3_e89870a2	b	I can't help but feel grateful to have the necessities here for us.	game/bank.rpy	628	b "[what]"
bank3_720b9069	b	Between this room for hygiene and the break room for food, we should be okay for now.	game/bank.rpy	629	b "[what]"
bank3_1adb3131	j	Yeah, I suppose...	game/bank.rpy	630	j "[what]"
bank3_89a4f20b	b	What's wrong?	game/bank.rpy	631	b "[what]"
bank3_a61b071a	j	Well, having food and a shower is great, but...	game/bank.rpy	632	j "[what]"
bank3_334e8d70	j	So far that hasn't been our issue.	game/bank.rpy	633	j "[what]"
bank3_e577fe2b	j	Our issue has been not knowing who the Game Master is, or who's planning a murder.	game/bank.rpy	634	j "[what]"
bank3_f5a59848	j	All these amenities to me are just... a false sense of security.	game/bank.rpy	635	j "[what]"
bank3_1a0c874b	bi	It really sucks to see Jenny sad like this...	game/bank.rpy	636	bi "[what]"
bank3_b4d41a9a	bi	Just a minute ago she was so upbeat.	game/bank.rpy	637	bi "[what]"
bank3_9375b43b	b	Hmm... I have an idea, but I don't want to rush anything.	game/bank.rpy	638	b "[what]"
bank3_c1303e2e	j	An idea? Is it about the safe?	game/bank.rpy	639	j "[what]"
bank3_0e5e1b78	b	Actually, no. The safe seems like a trap to me and I don't want to risk it.	game/bank.rpy	640	b "[what]"
bank3_0de5046f	b	I'm hoping Sam finds something useful in the records.	game/bank.rpy	641	b "[what]"
bank3_1b1a42a6	b	Once we finish exploring and regroup with everyone else we can discuss it.	game/bank.rpy	642	b "[what]"
bank3_20959928	j	Well, like I said, I know I can trust you Bert.	game/bank.rpy	643	j "[what]"
bank3_f9c6f03a	j	I'm sure we'll be fine!	game/bank.rpy	645	j "[what]"
bank3_bddbe2aa	j	Anyway, you think I have time for a quick shower?	game/bank.rpy	646	j "[what]"
bank3_5b2652b8	bi	And she's right back to happy-go-lucky mode.	game/bank.rpy	647	bi "[what]"
bank3_1d4143ce	b	Let's head back to the lobby for now, it's the last room we need to really explore.	game/bank.rpy	648	b "[what]"
bank3_bb927a39	b	We'll have more time to shower and eat and stuff in a bit.	game/bank.rpy	649	b "[what]"
bank3_4581ffe5	j	A-OK!	game/bank.rpy	650	j "[what]"
bank3_9f7922a1	j	Seems like everyone else is still exploring.	game/bank.rpy	657	j "[what]"
bank3_2802f0df	b	Or eating all the snacks in the break room...	game/bank.rpy	658	b "[what]"
bank3_a5424667	j	Either way, we have some time to look around in here.	game/bank.rpy	659	j "[what]"
bank3_ccf1880d	bi	We spent some time looking around the lobby, then regrouped.	game/bank.rpy	661	bi "[what]"
bank3_d68fb4c5	j	Well, I've got good news and bad news.	game/bank.rpy	663	j "[what]"
bank3_3a54b442	j	The bad news is that there's definitely no way to get out of here.	game/bank.rpy	664	j "[what]"
bank3_1a0dc4b3	j	Everything's boarded up again, not very surprising.	game/bank.rpy	665	j "[what]"
bank3_dfd723ab	b	And the good news?	game/bank.rpy	666	b "[what]"
bank3_c805bf34	j	Oh, did I say there was good news?	game/bank.rpy	667	j "[what]"
bank3_d13c86f7	j	My mistake! No good news.	game/bank.rpy	669	j "[what]"
bank3_1e54ddb3	j	At least the benches and couches look cozy to sleep on later.	game/bank.rpy	670	j "[what]"
bank3_850ef128	b	...	game/bank.rpy	672	b "[what]"
bank3_58b66693	bi	She is right though, there isn't much of anything in here.	game/bank.rpy	673	bi "[what]"
bank3_22b12e69	bi	Lots of insignificant office supplies.	game/bank.rpy	674	bi "[what]"
bank3_b8fe2555	bi	We found paper, a small amount of cash, some pens, a few small burlap bags.	game/bank.rpy	675	bi "[what]"
bank3_8f3fed71	b	This is quite a big space we're trapped in, but there's not much happening.	game/bank.rpy	676	b "[what]"
bank3_8720e3cc	b	Also, thankfully, there's no convoluted "prisoner-guard" dynamic this time.	game/bank.rpy	677	b "[what]"
bank3_bf3e302b	b	We get to all work together a bit easier.	game/bank.rpy	678	b "[what]"
bank3_0dcb0127	j	I'm beat! I'll be over here if you need me.	game/bank.rpy	679	j "[what]"
bank3_0700c1f2	bi	She plopped down on a bench across the room.	game/bank.rpy	681	bi "[what]"
bank3_6064b1e8	bi	I can't blame her, this is a lot of new information to take in.	game/bank.rpy	682	bi "[what]"
bank3_3ff85d1d	bi	Well, it seems like everyone's doing something for a bit.	game/bank.rpy	683	bi "[what]"
bank3_2088b3fe	bi	Let's make sure we stay upbeat and keep busy.	game/bank.rpy	684	bi "[what]"
bank4_e4adad87	bi	After a while, everyone returned to the lobby.	game/bank.rpy	688	bi "[what]"
bank4_dac9e184	bi	We brought some food from the kitchen and recapped what we found.	game/bank.rpy	689	bi "[what]"
bank4_5c331faf	b	So the big rooms are this lobby, the kitchen, a director's office, and a locker room.	game/bank.rpy	694	b "[what]"
bank4_d1fe6c45	b	The keys for the lockers are missing, but they're all open anyway.	game/bank.rpy	695	b "[what]"
bank4_c44a5c4e	bi	Well, not exactly, but that's effectively the truth.	game/bank.rpy	696	bi "[what]"
bank4_21751d84	b	There's also a safe we can supposedly open using three of our birthdates.	game/bank.rpy	697	b "[what]"
bank4_15b6ce00	b	But whoever inputs a code dies if they input the wrong code.	game/bank.rpy	698	b "[what]"
bank4_1e73aae6	b	Which means someone could lie about their birthday to murder someone else.	game/bank.rpy	699	b "[what]"
bank4_2664455e	l	Sid, did you have any luck finding a vault key or code somewhere?	game/bank.rpy	701	l "[what]"
bank4_319f29db	i	I don't think it'll open unless we use our birthdates...	game/bank.rpy	707	i "[what]"
bank4_07fcce84	i	Are you all suuure you won't tell me them?	game/bank.rpy	708	i "[what]"
bank4_ba3ab19a	l	No shot.	game/bank.rpy	709	l "[what]"
bank4_5014a9b4	l	If I did I'd tell you the truth, but I'm not risking anyone else lying to you.	game/bank.rpy	710	l "[what]"
bank4_3f450336	l	Who's to say there's even anything in there?	game/bank.rpy	711	l "[what]"
bank4_b89cefd4	i	Alright...	game/bank.rpy	712	i "[what]"
bank4_e1f86b33	l	And besides, there are only six of us here.	game/bank.rpy	713	l "[what]"
bank4_7ce8e4bc	l	It seems pretty unlikely someone plots a whole murder without us noticing.	game/bank.rpy	714	l "[what]"
bank4_b9143a1f	b	There are so few of us.	game/bank.rpy	715	b "[what]"
bank4_ea4e2225	b	We can even all sleep in the same room now, since this place is pretty big.	game/bank.rpy	716	b "[what]"
bank4_bc0bf266	i	Huh? Do I have to? There's a cozy looking sofa out in the hallway.	game/bank.rpy	717	i "[what]"
bank4_690fba08	l	Where?	game/bank.rpy	718	l "[what]"
bank4_bf6a4ff7	bi	Sid grabbed a pen and started drawing on the map.	game/bank.rpy	719	bi "[what]"
bank4_31515a79	i	I think it was in this corner.	game/bank.rpy	721	i "[what]"
bank4_f25a7c07	j	Oh, I saw that too.	game/bank.rpy	725	j "[what]"
bank4_82de5c81	b	I didn't notice. Is there anything else worth putting on the map?	game/bank.rpy	726	b "[what]"
bank4_eaeb62c3	i	I guess the vault door, since we can't open it anyway...	game/bank.rpy	727	i "[what]"
bank4_0b1566ad	f	Oooo! Draw a duck!	game/bank.rpy	731	f "[what]"
bank4_850ef128	b	...	game/bank.rpy	732	b "[what]"
bank4_f2d04d63	i	Right, of course.	game/bank.rpy	733	i "[what]"
bank4_324436db	b	......	game/bank.rpy	737	b "[what]"
bank4_33e6e414	b	Okay cool, the map is up to date.	game/bank.rpy	738	b "[what]"
bank4_20d61258	f	Mhm, mhm.	game/bank.rpy	741	f "[what]"
bank4_188a9e3c	j	So Freddy, what did we talk about?	game/bank.rpy	752	j "[what]"
bank4_a7ea955f	f	Coffee pods are bad for the environment!	game/bank.rpy	753	f "[what]"
bank4_1f9f7182	f	Unless you use reusable ones!	game/bank.rpy	754	f "[what]"
bank4_3a7b5de0	f	But you're too lazy to do that!	game/bank.rpy	755	f "[what]"
bank4_0e14ee5d	f	So you just use a coffee maker instead!	game/bank.rpy	756	f "[what]"
bank4_5b338e46	j	Exactly! Wait, I mean, about the safe though.	game/bank.rpy	758	j "[what]"
bank4_7f8bff71	f	Oh!	game/bank.rpy	759	f "[what]"
bank4_01a1b857	f	Don't tell anyone my birthday.	game/bank.rpy	760	f "[what]"
bank4_67f6b626	f	Not even Jenny mom or Lauren mom.	game/bank.rpy	761	f "[what]"
bank4_01463c1e	f	And especially not Sid!	game/bank.rpy	762	f "[what]"
bank4_ac00bb37	j	Exactly!	game/bank.rpy	763	j "[what]"
bank4_034a0890	j	You learn so fast.	game/bank.rpy	764	j "[what]"
bank4_71313f1b	bi	Maybe not the most elegant solution, but it's a good idea.	game/bank.rpy	766	bi "[what]"
bank4_0186224e	bi	We don't want anyone dying because because they trust Freddy and one other person.	game/bank.rpy	767	bi "[what]"
bank4_13d7ff02	f	Bert? Can I play with Sesame?	game/bank.rpy	768	f "[what]"
bank4_9d47e876	ses	Mrowwwwwwwwwwww!	game/bank.rpy	769	ses "[what]"
bank4_cbdd679f	b	Sure Freddy, have fun.	game/bank.rpy	770	b "[what]"
bank4_8bb721fe	s	By the way...	game/bank.rpy	774	s "[what]"
bank4_854c8814	s	I didn't find anything notable in the files.	game/bank.rpy	775	s "[what]"
bank4_e616970d	b	Really?! Nothing useful?	game/bank.rpy	776	b "[what]"
bank4_bd78882e	j	No records with any of our names?	game/bank.rpy	777	j "[what]"
bank4_eecf7526	s	Nope. I even went through them all twice.	game/bank.rpy	778	s "[what]"
bank4_a14d294c	b	Shoot... I was really hoping we'd know who to either protect or be wary of...	game/bank.rpy	779	b "[what]"
bank4_dec85dd8	j	Hmm... all the more reason to keep looking around!	game/bank.rpy	780	j "[what]"
bank4_de86f027	j	Wait up Freddy and Sesame!	game/bank.rpy	781	j "[what]"
bank4_e1554201	s	...	game/bank.rpy	786	s "[what]"
bank4_61c717a9	s	Come to the director's office with me.	game/bank.rpy	788	s "[what]"
bank4_4cfe1cb1	s	Alone.	game/bank.rpy	789	s "[what]"
bank4_1043e735	b	Huh?	game/bank.rpy	790	b "[what]"
bank4_79ff1cc3	bi	Go to the director's office?	game/bank.rpy	796	bi "[what]"
bank4_e2c29bad	bi	I thought Sam didn't find anything useful?	game/bank.rpy	797	bi "[what]"

bank4_4976afe6	b	Freddy?! He's just a little kid, why was his name in the bank records?	game/bank.rpy	836	b "[what]"
bank4_6b5a3ba3	s	Well, it wasn't exactly - There's someone in here with the name "Gerald Ogden."	game/bank.rpy	837	s "[what]"
bank4_767becfe	b	Gerald? Not Freddy, Fred, Fredrick?	game/bank.rpy	838	b "[what]"
bank4_c2b5f789	s	Well, it's not Freddy.	game/bank.rpy	839	s "[what]"

bank4_05f0b67e	b	Gerald Ogden... interesting.	game/bank.rpy	844	b "[what]"
bank4_a650dfb9	b	There's even a picture of him.	game/bank.rpy	845	b "[what]"
bank4_89878fc5	b	Very... powerful eyebrows and mustache.	game/bank.rpy	846	b "[what]"
bank4_d7394c8b	b	Do you think this guy is related to Freddy?	game/bank.rpy	847	b "[what]"
bank4_b75d3b12	s	It's a very unique name, it can't be a coincidence...	game/bank.rpy	848	s "[what]"
bank4_3607d3c2	s	Besides, I didn't see anyone else's name in the files.	game/bank.rpy	849	s "[what]"
bank4_3af73169	s	If they're of any use to us, this is it.	game/bank.rpy	850	s "[what]"
bank4_4f74f477	b	Hmm... Let's see what the file says about him.	game/bank.rpy	851	b "[what]"
bank4_d3dbdbd4	s	Let me know when you see it.	game/bank.rpy	852	s "[what]"
bank4_693e7313	b	It?	game/bank.rpy	853	b "[what]"
bank4_95b2e0fb	b	Wait... 10.3 million dollars...	game/bank.rpy	856	b "[what]"
bank4_ab4378f8	b	Is this how much money he has in his account?	game/bank.rpy	857	b "[what]"
bank4_a567cea7	s	No, that's how much his balance increased last year.	game/bank.rpy	858	s "[what]"
bank4_5ff4e3cd	b	HE MADE $10.3 MILLION IN ONE YEAR?!	game/bank.rpy	859	b "[what]"
bank4_36efcf7f	s	That's what the document says.	game/bank.rpy	860	s "[what]"
bank4_4e411dc6	b	Why is so much stuff crossed out?	game/bank.rpy	861	b "[what]"
bank4_e1fa6bbb	s	If the artist filled in those details they'd be wasting their time.	game/bank.rpy	862	s "[what]"
bank4_1043e735_1	b	Huh?	game/bank.rpy	863	b "[what]"
bank4_9fa94fb3	s	I mean, uh...	game/bank.rpy	864	s "[what]"
bank4_9d4290b5	s	It could be a file only used for specific things, like an audit or taxes.	game/bank.rpy	865	s "[what]"
bank4_21b4dd96	s	In cases like that, the bankers will block out everything they don't need.	game/bank.rpy	866	s "[what]"
bank4_dfcebf45	b	That makes sense...	game/bank.rpy	867	b "[what]"
bank4_1eb49f7a	b	But the change in balance isn't crossed out...	game/bank.rpy	868	b "[what]"
bank4_b5ec7217	b	That's... a lot of... wow.	game/bank.rpy	870	b "[what]"
bank4_0fe02b60	b	Freddy comes from a family of multimillionaires?	game/bank.rpy	871	b "[what]"
bank4_47a976d1	s	Honestly, the dude is probably a billionaire.	game/bank.rpy	872	s "[what]"
bank4_8a1232d2	s	He probably has multiple accounts, and other places he keeps his money for tax purposes.	game/bank.rpy	873	s "[what]"
bank4_0f6298d7	s	Not to mention whatever business assets he has that aren't liquid income.	game/bank.rpy	874	s "[what]"
bank4_69670074	s	This isn't really that much money in the grand scheme of things.	game/bank.rpy	875	s "[what]"
bank4_89981e34	b	Sorry, you said ten million isn't that much money?	game/bank.rpy	876	b "[what]"
bank4_a7779455	s	{i}In the grand scheme of things{/i}.	game/bank.rpy	877	s "[what]"
bank4_e9b1ec7c	s	It's a lot more than I'll ever have, that's for sure, but...	game/bank.rpy	878	s "[what]"
bank4_b4e8620a	s	Most big bank chains hold trillions of dollars.	game/bank.rpy	879	s "[what]"
bank4_f9df52bb	b	I can't believe Freddy's dad... well, the guy we think is his dad is that kind of person.	game/bank.rpy	880	b "[what]"
bank4_43440552	b	He seems like any other goofy kid to me...	game/bank.rpy	881	b "[what]"
bank4_9d0307b0	s	That's why I asked you to come.	game/bank.rpy	882	s "[what]"
bank4_87a68339	b	What do you mean?	game/bank.rpy	883	b "[what]"
bank4_9fad888f	s	I was worried about presenting this to everyone.	game/bank.rpy	884	s "[what]"
bank4_7190cbb3	s	I don't know how they would react.	game/bank.rpy	885	s "[what]"
bank4_d19e3c4c	s	Honestly, I don't know how {i}I{/i} would have reacted to this if we found before... well, Stella died.	game/bank.rpy	886	s "[what]"
bank4_19efb903	b	It's not the same for you now?	game/bank.rpy	887	b "[what]"
bank4_62089450	s	Now I'm just... going through the motions.	game/bank.rpy	888	s "[what]"
bank4_5b1545ea	s	Doing what I can.	game/bank.rpy	889	s "[what]"
bank4_2284c4a6	s	But for someone like Sid...	game/bank.rpy	890	s "[what]"
bank4_8c532bd2	s	That's more than life changing money.	game/bank.rpy	891	s "[what]"
bank4_8b1721a4	s	Sid would definitely turn against Freddy if he thought he could get some of it.	game/bank.rpy	892	s "[what]"
bank4_8e2cc342	s	Plus, I think showing Freddy would scare the hell out of him.	game/bank.rpy	893	s "[what]"
bank4_fc8034bc	s	He might not even know his dad is this rich, given what he's said.	game/bank.rpy	894	s "[what]"
bank4_8fe139be	s	Sounds like he lives a pretty sheltered life.	game/bank.rpy	895	s "[what]"
bank4_8d649182	b	Yeah, you're right.	game/bank.rpy	896	b "[what]"
bank4_750251a3	b	It's smart to be hesitant about showing people.	game/bank.rpy	897	b "[what]"
bank4_53651616	b	Still, I think talking to Jenny or even Lauren about it would be fine.	game/bank.rpy	898	b "[what]"
bank4_638b1655	b	I just... don't know what to do with this information yet.	game/bank.rpy	899	b "[what]"
bank4_e9ac560d	b	Should we confront Freddy? He's just a kid...	game/bank.rpy	900	b "[what]"
bank4_2009b9b8	s	Well, we don't even know if they're related.	game/bank.rpy	901	s "[what]"
bank4_444c5d93	s	They might just have the same last name.	game/bank.rpy	902	s "[what]"
bank4_fe8741a0	s	What if we just ask him his dad's name?	game/bank.rpy	903	s "[what]"
bank4_601da023	b	That's true. If he says his dad's name is Gerald, we can go from there.	game/bank.rpy	904	b "[what]"
bank4_5d8ddc01	s	But I can't be the one to do it.	game/bank.rpy	905	s "[what]"
bank4_87a68339_1	b	What do you mean?	game/bank.rpy	906	b "[what]"
bank4_abf0c09f	s	I think Freddy's scared of me.	game/bank.rpy	907	s "[what]"
bank4_ca84862f	s	And honestly, fair enough.	game/bank.rpy	908	s "[what]"
bank4_497b8574	bi	Yeah...	game/bank.rpy	909	bi "[what]"
bank4_4bc724ae	s	But you, Jenny, or even Lauren could ask him.	game/bank.rpy	910	s "[what]"
bank4_a2d22ef0	b	Hmm, I don't think he {i}likes{/i} me, but we can make it work.	game/bank.rpy	911	b "[what]"
bank4_ce210179	bi	The last time I talked to him alone was really awkward...	game/bank.rpy	912	bi "[what]"
bank4_bfd3b3b0	b	Maybe Jenny can help me break the ice.	game/bank.rpy	913	b "[what]"
bank4_c0126d67	j	Someone say Jenny?	game/bank.rpy	920	j "[what]"
bank4_8f24eab0	s	Speak of the barbie.	game/bank.rpy	921	s "[what]"
bank4_6a6dbbf8	j	Find something juicy?	game/bank.rpy	922	j "[what]"
bank4_b293ce3f	s	We found... something.	game/bank.rpy	923	s "[what]"
bank4_bcd9f537	b	There's a file about someone who could be related to Freddy.	game/bank.rpy	925	b "[what]"
bank4_f3c87d1c	b	A guy named Gerald Ogden.	game/bank.rpy	926	b "[what]"
bank4_a0023482	s	He's insanely rich, too.	game/bank.rpy	927	s "[what]"
bank4_95bf0c48	s	Easily one of the largest accounts in this whole bank.	game/bank.rpy	928	s "[what]"
bank4_244a8a33	j	How big we talking?	game/bank.rpy	929	j "[what]"
bank4_7450a6a5	b	Last year his main account gained over 10 million dollars.	game/bank.rpy	930	b "[what]"
bank4_0dc12347	j	So Freddy might be... the richest frog ever...	game/bank.rpy	931	j "[what]"
bank4_17f86236	j	Well, except for maybe that prince that turned into a frog...	game/bank.rpy	932	j "[what]"
bank4_5183a296	b	To be clear, we're not sure if they're actually related.	game/bank.rpy	933	b "[what]"
bank4_f1d5ccec	b	We're hoping to figure that out.	game/bank.rpy	934	b "[what]"
bank4_a5f2b855	b	Jenny, do you think you can help me talk to Freddy tomorrow?	game/bank.rpy	935	b "[what]"
bank4_d40faf7d	b	I don't want to scare him, but it can't hurt to ask him what his dad's name is.	game/bank.rpy	936	b "[what]"
bank4_79325c00	j	Sounds like a plan.	game/bank.rpy	937	j "[what]"
bank4_74f3fc0c	s	Great.	game/bank.rpy	938	s "[what]"
bank4_ff8cfe64	s	Half of us know about this now, but I still think we should hide the file.	game/bank.rpy	939	s "[what]"
bank4_5c0df542	j	May I take a look?	game/bank.rpy	940	j "[what]"
bank4_d8895f17	bi	I handed her the file. After just a quick glance...	game/bank.rpy	941	bi "[what]"
bank4_93feb17a	j	Wait... there's a picture here.	game/bank.rpy	943	j "[what]"
bank4_1a98b9db	s	Yeah, he's got a goofy mustache and really unique facial hair color...	game/bank.rpy	944	s "[what]"
bank4_761400ff	j	No, no, not that... th-this doesn't make any sense.	game/bank.rpy	945	j "[what]"
bank4_45e2328d	b	What's wrong Jenny?	game/bank.rpy	946	b "[what]"
bank4_8592ab1a	j	The man in this picture... it's unmistakable.	game/bank.rpy	947	j "[what]"
bank4_d0854182	j	Gerald Ogden? No...	game/bank.rpy	948	j "[what]"
bank4_aa034e4b	j	He's the man that I was... I was arrested for protesting.	game/bank.rpy	949	j "[what]"
bank4_821183ba	bi	Jenny's story back at the mansion came streaming back to me.	game/bank.rpy	950	bi "[what]"
bank4_84b457cd	j	From day one it was so clear he was guilty.	game/bank.rpy	958	j "[what]"
bank4_45df2d8a	j	And I mean, guilty guilty.	game/bank.rpy	959	j "[what]"
bank4_7b81f71b	j	They had several eye witnesses for tons of different crimes.	game/bank.rpy	960	j "[what]"
bank4_edf42a95	j	And then guess what happened?	game/bank.rpy	961	j "[what]"
bank4_6f352d16	b	I'm... kinda scared to know.	game/bank.rpy	962	b "[what]"
bank4_ed17ca9a	j	He was found not guilty, walked out with not even a slap on the wrist.	game/bank.rpy	963	j "[what]"
bank4_ca5d6072	j	Everyone at town hall went ballistic... it was the craziest thing I've ever seen.	game/bank.rpy	964	j "[what]"
bank4_2691c8d6	j	People started screaming, fighting, crying.	game/bank.rpy	965	j "[what]"
bank4_a1d8cbc5	j	And ya know, I've always been a bit of a loudmouth...	game/bank.rpy	966	j "[what]"
bank4_47181050	j	I may or may not have... screamed some choice words at the judge and jury.	game/bank.rpy	967	j "[what]"
bank4_6255cdbc	j	This can't be right! His name isn't Gerald Ogden...	game/bank.rpy	978	j "[what]"
bank4_accf17c1	j	At least, it wasn't back then... his name was Jereldino Ogarian.	game/bank.rpy	979	j "[what]"
bank4_c424f092	s	Slow down, what the hell are you talking about?	game/bank.rpy	980	s "[what]"
bank4_68518a71	j	My crime... it's after protesting a court decision about... this guy.	game/bank.rpy	981	j "[what]"
bank4_fe9804dc	b	Are you sure that's him in the picture?	game/bank.rpy	982	b "[what]"
bank4_cc189dd8	j	I'm positive.	game/bank.rpy	983	j "[what]"
bank4_786376be	s	Maybe he got a name change?	game/bank.rpy	984	s "[what]"
bank4_6027ffc1	b	"Jereldino Ogarian" and "Gerald Ogden"... they're pretty similar.	game/bank.rpy	985	b "[what]"
bank4_ede77fd7	b	It's not uncommon for people with difficult to pronounce names to adopt a more "normal" name.	game/bank.rpy	986	b "[what]"
bank4_7c9b4bab	b	Especially immigrants trying to improve their chances or their kids' chances in society.	game/bank.rpy	987	b "[what]"
bank4_ad1437f2	b	My birth name isn't actually "Bert" believe it or not...	game/bank.rpy	988	b "[what]"
bank4_f65f510e	j	I don't think that was why he did it...	game/bank.rpy	989	j "[what]"
bank4_9529b8dc	j	He was already pretty successful when that court case happened.	game/bank.rpy	990	j "[what]"
bank4_64f8bebc	s	Yeah, there's a much more obvious reason.	game/bank.rpy	991	s "[what]"
bank4_a0f2a101	s	He just changed his name to avoid the bad publicity.	game/bank.rpy	992	s "[what]"
bank4_8ddd43f5	j	But... but he's still the same person!	game/bank.rpy	993	j "[what]"
bank4_c9cae45e	s	Yeah, but the public has a short attention span.	game/bank.rpy	994	s "[what]"
bank4_2ff8b28f	s	Anyway, if this really is him, that file's proof of his wealth.	game/bank.rpy	995	s "[what]"
bank4_640bd6a8	b	So, the man you were enraged over might be... Freddy's dad.	game/bank.rpy	996	b "[what]"
bank4_8f684401	j	Th-that doesn't make sense either!	game/bank.rpy	997	j "[what]"
bank4_66d0c663	j	He didn't have a family, it was even mentioned in his defense.	game/bank.rpy	998	j "[what]"
bank4_d022556c	s	He might have been keeping them a secret.	game/bank.rpy	999	s "[what]"
bank4_ce6dba70	b	Why?	game/bank.rpy	1000	b "[what]"
bank4_362867a6	s	Maybe for their own safety.	game/bank.rpy	1001	s "[what]"
bank4_06ef9ed5	s	Being the wife and son of a well-known criminal probably makes life hard.	game/bank.rpy	1002	s "[what]"
bank4_cb1bcaf7	b	Freddy has told us he doesn't really see his dad much.	game/bank.rpy	1003	b "[what]"
bank4_3385647c	b	Maybe, well... you know, his dad doesn't want the public to know about them for other reasons.	game/bank.rpy	1004	b "[what]"
bank4_9f9ce7fb	s	Maybe Freddy's mom is a mistress of his?	game/bank.rpy	1005	s "[what]"
bank4_7231d283	b	Um... I don't think that's the kind of thing you just lightly suggest.	game/bank.rpy	1006	b "[what]"
bank4_d0628a75	s	Hey, it's not uncommon for rich guys.	game/bank.rpy	1007	s "[what]"
bank4_39202b95	b	Yeah, but it's still rude to Freddy, right Je-	game/bank.rpy	1008	b "[what]"
bank4_4ced7975	b	Jenny?	game/bank.rpy	1009	b "[what]"
bank4_376ff498	bi	Jenny had turned noticably paler.	game/bank.rpy	1010	bi "[what]"
bank4_7b5069f3	b	Jenny, are you alright?	game/bank.rpy	1011	b "[what]"
bank4_19951240	j	S-sorry, I'm just a little shook...	game/bank.rpy	1012	j "[what]"
bank4_9ed23b3c	j	I never wanted to see that face again.	game/bank.rpy	1013	j "[what]"
bank4_eb37c2f1	j	And maybe... that's why I'm here. Stuck in this messed up game.	game/bank.rpy	1014	j "[what]"
bank4_ce9ab2a3	j	He's taking revenge on me...	game/bank.rpy	1015	j "[what]"
bank4_c5786ade	b	You don't need to scare yourself like that...	game/bank.rpy	1016	b "[what]"
bank4_32dbd7eb	b	After all, he wasn't even found guilty.	game/bank.rpy	1017	b "[what]"
bank4_9315bbf0	b	There'd be no reason to hold a grudge against some random girl.	game/bank.rpy	1018	b "[what]"
bank4_8f2e8326	j	That's true, I suppose...	game/bank.rpy	1020	j "[what]"
bank4_ebeed432	j	With all that said...	game/bank.rpy	1021	j "[what]"
bank4_28fc29c9	j	I really hope this guy isn't Freddy's dad.	game/bank.rpy	1022	j "[what]"
bank4_7a3573c4	s	He'd have to be a pretty bad father to outweigh that money.	game/bank.rpy	1023	s "[what]"
bank4_fb982495	j	He's the slimiest businessman I can think of, that's for sure.	game/bank.rpy	1024	j "[what]"
bank4_23520510	j	His level of corruption would put even Stella's to shame.	game/bank.rpy	1025	j "[what]"

bank5_f39c26fc	j	I'll go grab it.	game/bank.rpy	1292	j "[what]"
bank5_47b7655e	b	Oh, you're right... okay.	game/bank.rpy	1293	b "[what]"
bank5_06008e3e	b	I have the key to the locker in my bag.	game/bank.rpy	1294	b "[what]"
bank5_99daa93d	bi	I peaked into my backpack and realized my mistake.	game/bank.rpy	1295	bi "[what]"
bank5_d7653b1f	b	Ummm... I don't know which key it was.	game/bank.rpy	1296	b "[what]"
bank5_2c209f39	b	But I know it was the bottom left locker on the wall.	game/bank.rpy	1297	b "[what]"
bank5_c59f526a	j	That's fine, I'll just try them until it works.	game/bank.rpy	1298	j "[what]"
bank5_392add4a	j	Alright, Team Mystery Busters, let's meet back in the lobby in 10 minutes!	game/bank.rpy	1300	j "[what]"
bank5_2867e55b	b	Team Mystery Busters?	game/bank.rpy	1301	b "[what]"
bank5_bb3b30a9	j	That's us!	game/bank.rpy	1302	j "[what]"
bank5_1600cbb9	bi	After "Team Mystery Busters" split up, I made my way back to the lobby.	game/bank.rpy	1305	bi "[what]"
bank5_2c414022	b	Hey, I need to tell you guys something. It's about Freddy.	game/bank.rpy	1314	b "[what]"
bank5_619edd04	l	Oh?	game/bank.rpy	1315	l "[what]"
bank5_35cc39cb	i	Is it his birthday?	game/bank.rpy	1316	i "[what]"
bank5_ccb47084	b	No, not that...	game/bank.rpy	1317	b "[what]"
bank5_4fa3df9a	b	We found some info about his dad. Well, we think it's his dad, at least.	game/bank.rpy	1318	b "[what]"
bank5_9e1349ec	b	It might just be a coincidence, but...	game/bank.rpy	1319	b "[what]"
bank5_16ec03d2	b	It's a guy with the name Gerald Ogden.	game/bank.rpy	1320	b "[what]"
bank5_5b8fe16a	l	Just like Freddy Ogden...	game/bank.rpy	1321	l "[what]"
bank5_e9c10745	b	Exactly. He has an account here...	game/bank.rpy	1322	b "[what]"
bank5_fde75d10	b	And the balance increased by 10.3 million dollars in just one year.	game/bank.rpy	1323	b "[what]"
bank5_850ef128_1	b	...	game/bank.rpy	1324	b "[what]"
bank5_7dea3ec9	b	... Well? Say something!	game/bank.rpy	1325	b "[what]"
bank5_6f3d4875	i	...	game/bank.rpy	1326	i "[what]"
bank5_3bba143a	i	...........	game/bank.rpy	1327	i "[what]"
bank5_5990f24f	i	What the hell?! Ten million?!	game/bank.rpy	1329	i "[what]"
bank5_ac804916	l	In a year...	game/bank.rpy	1330	l "[what]"
bank5_dc75758d	l	That's... an insane amount of money.	game/bank.rpy	1331	l "[what]"
bank5_554326dd	i	This changes everything!	game/bank.rpy	1332	i "[what]"
bank5_6f2a1fba	i	I say we kill the runt and use his bones to pry open the vault!	game/bank.rpy	1333	i "[what]"
bank5_14946422	b	Calm down, we're going to figure this all out.	game/bank.rpy	1334	b "[what]"
bank5_86710def	b	We don't even know if they're related, it might just be the same last name.	game/bank.rpy	1335	b "[what]"
bank5_fc156217	l	Plus, it's not like Freddy has the money himself.	game/bank.rpy	1336	l "[what]"
bank5_e486dd7e	l	He is just a kid, after all.	game/bank.rpy	1337	l "[what]"
bank5_77c1a1eb	i	Well, I... I could get him to tell me his birthday!	game/bank.rpy	1338	i "[what]"
bank5_fd6a559c	i	And we could ALL open the safe!	game/bank.rpy	1339	i "[what]"
bank5_dfb9601d	i	10.3 million dollars... I'll even share a bit to whoever gives me the third birthday!	game/bank.rpy	1340	i "[what]"
bank5_62e3c967	b	This is why we didn't want to tell you...	game/bank.rpy	1341	b "[what]"
bank5_b8c08d3b	b	We just want to figure out if they're actually related.	game/bank.rpy	1342	b "[what]"
bank5_5d4f84ed	b	If they are, we'd need to put extra protection on Freddy from a murder attempt.	game/bank.rpy	1343	b "[what]"
bank5_09ba10cf	l	I think Sid's the only one you'll have to protect him from.	game/bank.rpy	1344	l "[what]"
bank5_ed7defc5	i	We need to get into that vault...	game/bank.rpy	1345	i "[what]"
bank5_2cbf8aff	bi	This is not as productive as I'd hoped...	game/bank.rpy	1346	bi "[what]"
bank5_d280417b	s	You're such an idiot, Sid...	game/bank.rpy	1350	s "[what]"
bank5_86518984	s	Like Bert said, we don't even know if Freddy's related to Gerald. It could just be chance.	game/bank.rpy	1351	s "[what]"
bank5_f6c68158	s	Or worse... a ploy by the Game Master to confuse us.	game/bank.rpy	1352	s "[what]"
bank5_5affdd1e	i	Wait a minute - you said there's a picture of this Gerald guy?	game/bank.rpy	1354	i "[what]"
bank5_20a72960	b	Yeah, in the file... why?	game/bank.rpy	1355	b "[what]"
bank5_ec82a85b	i	We can just check if they look similar!	game/bank.rpy	1356	i "[what]"
bank5_77508b5b	s	We would have to make Freddy take off his mask, though...	game/bank.rpy	1357	s "[what]"
bank5_d0584ea6	i	Only for a second! He can put it right back on after.	game/bank.rpy	1358	i "[what]"
bank5_1eff698d	b	Hmm, you do have a point.	game/bank.rpy	1359	b "[what]"
bank5_2a5e3516	b	We still haven't even seen his face.	game/bank.rpy	1360	b "[what]"
bank5_f24951b9	b	Maybe he wouldn't mind showing us?	game/bank.rpy	1361	b "[what]"
bank5_f53837bc	i	Yeah! And THEN we can whack him for his cash like a piñata!	game/bank.rpy	1362	i "[what]"
bank5_ab8e490e	b	Well, probably not that part.	game/bank.rpy	1363	b "[what]"
bank5_b592e750	b	Lauren, what do you think?	game/bank.rpy	1367	b "[what]"
bank5_2516e719	b	This way, maybe we wouldn't have to tell him we found his dad's file.	game/bank.rpy	1368	b "[what]"
bank5_ac00b60b	l	If I ask him, he might be open to it.	game/bank.rpy	1369	l "[what]"
bank5_9e1d45ca	s	I guess it's worth a shot then.	game/bank.rpy	1370	s "[what]"
bank5_2a334abd	b	Jenny's grabbing the file from the locker room right now.	game/bank.rpy	1371	b "[what]"
bank5_b3f4f3db	b	She'll be back in a minute.	game/bank.rpy	1372	b "[what]"
bank5_d23652c7	l	Poor Freddy either way, he's just a kid... This situation is so messed up.	game/bank.rpy	1373	l "[what]"
bank5_1a81f4a2	s	Yeah...	game/bank.rpy	1374	s "[what]"
bank5_3b718351	bi	Getting Freddy to take off his mask...	game/bank.rpy	1380	bi "[what]"
bank5_3508f91d	bi	It does seem like the most painless solution.	game/bank.rpy	1381	bi "[what]"
bank5_9aacf0ca	bi	It's going to be so strange though... I've gotten so used to him being a frog boy.	game/bank.rpy	1382	bi "[what]"
bank5_4755a82c	bi	How do we even know it's a kid under there?	game/bank.rpy	1383	bi "[what]"
bank5_07757ec7	bi	What if... he's a robot?	game/bank.rpy	1384	bi "[what]"
bank5_720206d9	bi	Or a really smart monkey?	game/bank.rpy	1385	bi "[what]"
bank5_ff0fd622	bi	I sound a bit like Jenny right now.	game/bank.rpy	1386	bi "[what]"
bank5_03529284	bi	He's probably just a harmless little kid, but now I'm nervous...	game/bank.rpy	1387	bi "[what]"
bank5_8b49ab28	bi	The most important thing is that we can protect him, whether he's related to Gerald or not.	game/bank.rpy	1388	bi "[what]"
bank5_495f9a90	j	Mission success!	game/bank.rpy	1393	j "[what]"
bank5_b67ca6f0	j	I got the file, and we made it back alive!	game/bank.rpy	1394	j "[what]"
bank5_a5282a2c	bi	Usually that expression is an exaggeration, but given the circumstances...	game/bank.rpy	1395	bi "[what]"
bank5_abfc54f6	b	Great, thanks Jenny.	game/bank.rpy	1396	b "[what]"
bank5_5f813a7a	b	Anyway, here's the plan.	game/bank.rpy	1397	b "[what]"
bank5_1c03468d	b	Lauren's going to ask Freddy to take his mask off.	game/bank.rpy	1399	b "[what]"
bank5_56399fa9	b	Maybe he has some distinct features that look like Gerald's.	game/bank.rpy	1400	b "[what]"
bank5_c5542d7b	b	That way, we can infer if him and Gerald are related without telling him everything.	game/bank.rpy	1401	b "[what]"
bank5_1934aa90	j	What?!	game/bank.rpy	1402	j "[what]"
bank5_f017f260	j	That's scary... how do we know if he's even a kid under there?	game/bank.rpy	1403	j "[what]"
bank5_a9d8597a	j	What if he's a robot, or a really smart monkey?	game/bank.rpy	1404	j "[what]"
bank5_281f445a	b	.	game/bank.rpy	1405	b "[what]"
bank5_e5469945	j	But you are right, it's a good plan...	game/bank.rpy	1406	j "[what]"
bank5_299fe56a	l	Freddy! I was just wondering something...	game/bank.rpy	1413	l "[what]"
bank5_e35b3a61	f	What is it!	game/bank.rpy	1414	f "[what]"
bank5_aff76a15	l	Well, you really like your frog suit, right!	game/bank.rpy	1415	l "[what]"
bank5_2229843a	f	Yes! I love it.	game/bank.rpy	1416	f "[what]"
bank5_9f4485a5	l	Jenny and I were thinking...	game/bank.rpy	1417	l "[what]"
bank5_f006d789	l	Ehhh, nevermind. Forget it!	game/bank.rpy	1418	l "[what]"
bank5_e42af8e1	f	What! I want to know!	game/bank.rpy	1420	f "[what]"
bank5_3f625f12	j	Lauren, you shouldn't...	game/bank.rpy	1421	j "[what]"
bank5_cc89c56f	f	Shouldn't what?!	game/bank.rpy	1422	f "[what]"
bank5_3ff034cb	f	please please please please pleaaaaaase tell me!	game/bank.rpy	1423	f "[what]"
bank5_bf4c3668	j	No no no, we shouldn't ask...	game/bank.rpy	1424	j "[what]"
bank5_c57500ba	f	B-but... please?	game/bank.rpy	1425	f "[what]"
bank5_8196dc5e	bi	Curiousity really is something.	game/bank.rpy	1426	bi "[what]"
bank5_d1e755d8	l	Okay, okay, fine.	game/bank.rpy	1427	l "[what]"
bank5_d23d0055	l	I was wondering...	game/bank.rpy	1428	l "[what]"
bank5_566c9558	l	What you looked like under your mask!	game/bank.rpy	1429	l "[what]"
bank5_187cf096	l	You said the face portion is removable, right?	game/bank.rpy	1430	l "[what]"
bank5_c3c1db58	f	Y-yes...	game/bank.rpy	1431	f "[what]"
bank5_cdbd86c0	j	If you're too shy, you don't have to show us!	game/bank.rpy	1432	j "[what]"
bank5_2d07afa6	l	But I bet you're reaaaaaaally cute!	game/bank.rpy	1433	l "[what]"
bank5_253be5b9	f	Ummmm...	game/bank.rpy	1434	f "[what]"
bank5_c18d16ab	f	Um um um ummmm...	game/bank.rpy	1435	f "[what]"
bank5_b7e85c19	f	Okay!	game/bank.rpy	1437	f "[what]"
bank5_d97cf2d3	f	You guys are my friends now, after all!	game/bank.rpy	1440	f "[what]"
bank5_29a07b9b	bi	Wow, Jenny and Lauren really are pros at this...	game/bank.rpy	1441	bi "[what]"
bank5_d4d2b8b2	j	Yay! Froggy face reveal!	game/bank.rpy	1442	j "[what]"
bank5_81a281fd	f	Okay, let me unbutton this...	game/bank.rpy	1444	f "[what]"
bank5_bdefcb38	f	And then...	game/bank.rpy	1445	f "[what]"
bank5_ccce41c1	f	3... 2... 1...	game/bank.rpy	1446	f "[what]"
bank5_fed1b566	f	Ta-da!	game/bank.rpy	1450	f "[what]"
bank5_ac68623f	bi	Oh boy...	game/bank.rpy	1451	bi "[what]"
bank5_260e482c	l	Aw! Freddy, your hair is so cute!	game/bank.rpy	1452	l "[what]"
bank5_3636daa2	f	Hehe, thanks Lauren!	game/bank.rpy	1454	f "[what]"
bank5_f197090a	j	I could just pinch your little cheeks!	game/bank.rpy	1455	j "[what]"
bank5_18b47c21	f	Hehe! You'll have to catch me first!	game/bank.rpy	1456	f "[what]"
bank5_850ef128_2	b	...	game/bank.rpy	1458	b "[what]"
bank5_35b8e1e5	j	Okay, so they're definitely related.	game/bank.rpy	1461	j "[what]"
bank5_cdeddc2e	l	Yeah, the hair is a dead giveaway...	game/bank.rpy	1462	l "[what]"
bank5_60c8c559	l	Who has naturally mint colored hair...	game/bank.rpy	1463	l "[what]"
bank5_e5e60209	j	What do we do now?	game/bank.rpy	1465	j "[what]"
bank5_39349db4	b	I was really hoping it would just be a coincidence...	game/bank.rpy	1466	b "[what]"
bank5_9276cd81	b	But it doesn't seem like it.	game/bank.rpy	1467	b "[what]"
bank5_8f4ada70	b	In any case, we need to protect him.	game/bank.rpy	1468	b "[what]"
bank5_5da14269	b	I'll stick with him for the rest of the night.	game/bank.rpy	1469	b "[what]"
bank5_e4ec0174	j	I can't believe I'm stuck here with that man's son...	game/bank.rpy	1470	j "[what]"
bank5_a3255fbf	j	It's like some sick joke.	game/bank.rpy	1471	j "[what]"
bank5_0e597160	b	For all intents and purposes, he's just a kid.	game/bank.rpy	1472	b "[what]"
bank5_245389ba	b	It doesn't even seem like he likes his father.	game/bank.rpy	1473	b "[what]"
bank5_a1e88cf4	j	Yeah, and at least he really is cute!	game/bank.rpy	1475	j "[what]"
bank5_a639382a	j	Some kids his age are butt ugly, haha!	game/bank.rpy	1476	j "[what]"
bank5_9c07e7e3	j	Let's get everyone together again and meet up to talk in a bit.	game/bank.rpy	1477	j "[what]"
bank5_c4d2eae2	j	Say, an hour in the lounge?	game/bank.rpy	1478	j "[what]"
bank5_03064712	l	Jenny seems pretty shaken by this.	game/bank.rpy	1484	l "[what]"
bank5_4531cd4d	l	I can't blame her, but... maybe she should keep an eye on her.	game/bank.rpy	1485	l "[what]"
bank5_c4e6bd4c	b	There's a lot to take.	game/bank.rpy	1486	b "[what]"
bank5_a1d88214	b	Two more people dead, Gerald's file, the vault...	game/bank.rpy	1487	b "[what]"
bank5_8e99db58	l	Speaking of the vault, I guess that means Freddy really is rich.	game/bank.rpy	1488	l "[what]"
bank5_ad600253	l	And that means the bank records are most likely real.	game/bank.rpy	1489	l "[what]"
bank5_980793cb	l	It makes me wonder how much money really is in the vault...	game/bank.rpy	1490	l "[what]"
bank5_50273445	b	Not enough to risk dying to get into it.	game/bank.rpy	1491	b "[what]"
bank5_bba84df3	b	Anyone could lie about their birthday, and we'd have no idea it was.	game/bank.rpy	1492	b "[what]"
bank5_e9e00db5	l	Yeah, I know, I know.	game/bank.rpy	1493	l "[what]"
bank5_6c35bc9a	l	I just can't help but be curious.	game/bank.rpy	1494	l "[what]"
bank5_5817dd0e	i	Oy, that kid really is loaded then, huh.	game/bank.rpy	1497	i "[what]"
bank5_5f7a6925	i	Little punk...	game/bank.rpy	1498	i "[what]"
bank5_7d085cb3	i	Say, what are the odds he set this whole thing up somehow?	game/bank.rpy	1499	i "[what]"
bank5_d095593a	b	You saw that he's like, eight, right?	game/bank.rpy	1500	b "[what]"
bank5_e41ab0fe	i	Okay or he's like that movie about the guy who ages backwards!	game/bank.rpy	1501	i "[what]"
bank5_275419dd	i	Alright, he's eight... but with that much money, maybe he did have something to do with it?	game/bank.rpy	1502	i "[what]"
bank5_ad16c00b	i	I mean, to set all this up...	game/bank.rpy	1503	i "[what]"
bank5_70e68d57	i	It must have been someone with boatloads of cash like that.	game/bank.rpy	1504	i "[what]"
bank5_6d1b8521	b	You're not wrong... Freddy's family probably is involved somehow.	game/bank.rpy	1505	b "[what]"
bank5_597e5ccf	b	The more we learn, the more it seems like we are all interconnected somehow.	game/bank.rpy	1506	b "[what]"
bank5_b136e46f	b	Stella with her business, Dracula and Shahar having a prior relationship...	game/bank.rpy	1507	b "[what]"
bank5_14a32f8b	b	Still, I don't think Freddy's the Game Master.	game/bank.rpy	1508	b "[what]"
bank5_475ec958	b	He doesn't even know his dad's first name, and this is a bit more complex than that.	game/bank.rpy	1509	b "[what]"
bank5_9b7795d8	i	Yeah, yeah...	game/bank.rpy	1510	i "[what]"
bank5_19ec4832	i	Anyway, I don't think I can get into the vault without the birthdays.	game/bank.rpy	1511	i "[what]"
bank5_53af29f4	i	This bank tech is way too much for me.	game/bank.rpy	1512	i "[what]"
bank5_d33af5f4	i	And that steel is really hard...	game/bank.rpy	1513	i "[what]"
bank5_f71c8a54	b	It's good that you tried, though.	game/bank.rpy	1514	b "[what]"
bank5_8a6a4f32	b	But until we run out of food we shouldn't even think about it.	game/bank.rpy	1515	b "[what]"
bank5_e239385c	b	It's way too risky.	game/bank.rpy	1516	b "[what]"
bank5_8ca755ed	i	Yeah, alright boss.	game/bank.rpy	1517	i "[what]"
bank5_19dd029d	i	But if it really is full of cash, you're getting the smallest cut.	game/bank.rpy	1518	i "[what]"
bank5_6a26061c	bi	He's... a good kid. Very driven, at least.	game/bank.rpy	1520	bi "[what]"
bank5_0c28194e	bi	I think I was rebelious around his age too.	game/bank.rpy	1521	bi "[what]"
bank5_5e80e269	bi	I've got a while until I need to meet back up with everyone.	game/bank.rpy	1522	bi "[what]"
bank5_17007082	bi	Let's find someone to talk to.	game/bank.rpy	1523	bi "[what]"
bank7_4e415df6	bi	After spending some time chatting, I went back to the lobby.	game/bank.rpy	1527	bi "[what]"
bank7_857b5280	s	I think everyone's here.	game/bank.rpy	1533	s "[what]"
bank7_be32d026	s	Do you really have any plan to protect Freddy?	game/bank.rpy	1534	s "[what]"
bank7_d1f991f1	b	Well...	game/bank.rpy	1535	b "[what]"
bank7_5eee5ef4	b	It depends how strict your definition of plan is.	game/bank.rpy	1536	b "[what]"
bank7_abf671e9	b	I'll do everything in my power to protect him, it's just...	game/bank.rpy	1537	b "[what]"
bank7_8496202f	l	We don't really have a lot of power.	game/bank.rpy	1543	l "[what]"
bank7_75ac9129	b	Yeah...	game/bank.rpy	1544	b "[what]"
bank7_effe858d	l	Still, I think at the very least we can take turns watching him very closely.	game/bank.rpy	1545	l "[what]"
bank7_6154cb74	l	Almost the level of constantly holding his hand.	game/bank.rpy	1546	l "[what]"
bank7_e0a4dcd7	j	That reminds me, actually...	game/bank.rpy	1550	j "[what]"
bank7_6ec59a7b	j	Remember back on the train, when Dan's murder happened?	game/bank.rpy	1551	j "[what]"
bank7_dc6308ec	j	I was holding Freddy's hand the whole time the lights were out.	game/bank.rpy	1552	j "[what]"
bank7_1b1fbd56	b	I do remember, you two were right next to me.	game/bank.rpy	1553	b "[what]"
bank7_6d6a9823	b	Maybe that's the solution we need.	game/bank.rpy	1554	b "[what]"
bank7_54c5aaf1	j	Or a leash!	game/bank.rpy	1556	j "[what]"
bank7_3d19b872	b	A leash? For Freddy?	game/bank.rpy	1557	b "[what]"
bank7_a6e65dd4	b	That seems like child abuse...	game/bank.rpy	1558	b "[what]"
bank7_1845375f	j	I mean, it would work!	game/bank.rpy	1560	j "[what]"
bank7_9337423d	b	Hmmm, maybe not the best idea.	game/bank.rpy	1561	b "[what]"
bank7_11d3c6f3	b	But for now, keeping him within arm's reach is a good plan.	game/bank.rpy	1562	b "[what]"
bank7_0f68542f	b	I'll keep him joined at my hip for the rest of the day.	game/bank.rpy	1563	b "[what]"
bank7_209ae227	b	Lauren, can you take over in the morning? Then we can plan from there.	game/bank.rpy	1564	b "[what]"
bank7_705a04b2	l	Sure.	game/bank.rpy	1565	l "[what]"
bank7_775eeeb8	bi	It'd be great to have a third person to watch him, but...	game/bank.rpy	1566	bi "[what]"
bank7_9f6fd918	bi	Maybe I shouldn't force Jenny alone with him.	game/bank.rpy	1567	bi "[what]"
bank7_d7839d26	j	Alright, if we're settled here, I'm gonna hit the locker room!	game/bank.rpy	1568	j "[what]"
bank7_316f8bbc	j	A nice hot shower would hit the spot right now.	game/bank.rpy	1569	j "[what]"
bank7_7ee76445	j	Lauren, wanna come with me?	game/bank.rpy	1570	j "[what]"
bank7_5e4a7a93	l	I won't join you in the shower, but I would like to explore this place a bit more.	game/bank.rpy	1571	l "[what]"
bank7_3999214e	i	Why didn't Jenny invite me to go shower...	game/bank.rpy	1581	i "[what]"
bank7_30aa2b58	s	You're such a dork.	game/bank.rpy	1582	s "[what]"
bank7_b79b324b	s	Anyway, I'm going to follow Lauren.	game/bank.rpy	1583	s "[what]"
bank7_7c916fee	s	I've only gotten a quick look at the locker room.	game/bank.rpy	1584	s "[what]"
bank7_4aa90949	s	I can come back to help you watch Freddy once I've explored a bit more.	game/bank.rpy	1585	s "[what]"
bank7_b9e8a6c4	b	Thanks Sam.	game/bank.rpy	1586	b "[what]"
bank7_33f0a3fc	i	I'm beat.	game/bank.rpy	1592	i "[what]"
bank7_6eb34104	i	Imagine, money and a solution to all this. It's so close, but out of reach...	game/bank.rpy	1593	i "[what]"
bank7_ef0d28b3	i	I get this whole Gerald thing is important, but it's hard not to think about the vault.	game/bank.rpy	1594	i "[what]"
bank7_cdf859d2	b	I'll tell you what, Sid.	game/bank.rpy	1595	b "[what]"
bank7_8935c791	b	If we get into the vault, you can have my share too.	game/bank.rpy	1596	b "[what]"
bank7_a60f0faa	i	Thanks Bert. I was already planning on taking it, but thanks.	game/bank.rpy	1597	i "[what]"
bank7_d6b2f6b5	bi	This kid...	game/bank.rpy	1598	bi "[what]"
bank7_a8e7cdf0	i	I'm gunna go look for more clues to the safe?	game/bank.rpy	1599	i "[what]"
bank7_a874d408	b	More clues?	game/bank.rpy	1600	b "[what]"
bank7_a69971e1	i	Yeah! What if the Game Master scratched the combination onto a wall somewhere?	game/bank.rpy	1601	i "[what]"
bank7_917ef3b5	bi	Sid really shouldn't be telling anyone that he'd try random numbers on a wall...	game/bank.rpy	1602	bi "[what]"
bank7_ed1954e1	b	Sid, you probably shouldn't-{p=0.5}{nw}	game/bank.rpy	1603	b "[what]"
bank7_c764c5f8	i	Seeya!	game/bank.rpy	1604	i "[what]"
bank7_29a92627	bi	...And he's gone.	game/bank.rpy	1607	bi "[what]"
bank7_e3180eb6	bi	I'm tired...	game/bank.rpy	1609	bi "[what]"
bank7_17d04dda	bi	It's been a while since we had anything of substance to eat.	game/bank.rpy	1610	bi "[what]"
bank7_06bdd44b	bi	If that tomato soup I made in the hospital even counts as food...	game/bank.rpy	1611	bi "[what]"
bank7_f04f58a0	f	Bert I wanna play!	game/bank.rpy	1612	f "[what]"
bank7_95048ca6	b	Aren't you tired?	game/bank.rpy	1613	b "[what]"
bank7_dd719550	f	Not tired not tired!	game/bank.rpy	1614	f "[what]"
bank7_5e6f9591	f	This is the first time I've been without my parents for this long.	game/bank.rpy	1615	f "[what]"
bank7_45dfbc7d	f	I wanna have fun! And play with all the things I'm not allowed to touch!	game/bank.rpy	1616	f "[what]"
bank7_6da75d99	bi	It's weird hearing him talk about his home life knowing who his dad is...	game/bank.rpy	1617	bi "[what]"
bank7_d4d245b4	b	Hmm... I think there are some supplies in the office.	game/bank.rpy	1618	b "[what]"
bank7_e25cfcde	b	How does arts and crafts sound?	game/bank.rpy	1619	b "[what]"
bank7_cae235fd	f	Yay yay yay yay!	game/bank.rpy	1621	f "[what]"
bank7_f1463dba	bi	Ok, phew, something that doesn't require me to really supervise him.	game/bank.rpy	1622	bi "[what]"
bank7_d599365a	bi	This will give me some much needed time to think...	game/bank.rpy	1623	bi "[what]"
bank7_14080975	b	Alright, there's some paper, and pens here.	game/bank.rpy	1630	b "[what]"
bank7_59c5c3b4	f	Are there markers or crayons?	game/bank.rpy	1631	f "[what]"
bank7_82e91d97	b	Um.. this room belongs to an old adult.	game/bank.rpy	1632	b "[what]"
bank7_360c642a	b	Adults are boring so they don't like to use markers or crayons.	game/bank.rpy	1633	b "[what]"
bank7_20a66f4b	f	Oh, that makes sense. Adults are boring.	game/bank.rpy	1634	f "[what]"
bank7_86dd8b33	f	Why do people grow up to become adults when they could become frogs?	game/bank.rpy	1635	f "[what]"
bank7_6b2e4875	bi	...He did mention he was taken out of the school system by his parents.	game/bank.rpy	1636	bi "[what]"
bank7_922fe6ae	f	Anyway, I want colors!	game/bank.rpy	1637	f "[what]"
bank7_c56c545f	b	Okay, let's compromise.	game/bank.rpy	1638	b "[what]"
bank7_eb75fa7e	f	Compro-... what?	game/bank.rpy	1639	f "[what]"
bank7_5f9cabc0	b	Uh. Make a deal.	game/bank.rpy	1640	b "[what]"
bank7_c73a8a55	b	I can't give you markers or crayons but...	game/bank.rpy	1641	b "[what]"
bank7_c9deeb16	b	You can draw for as long as you want!	game/bank.rpy	1642	b "[what]"
bank7_f4452749	f	Yay!	game/bank.rpy	1643	f "[what]"
bank7_f9c31308	bi	Kids are easy, you just have to trick them into thinking they want what you want.	game/bank.rpy	1644	bi "[what]"
bank7_2880d34d	bi	The longer he draws the less I have to entertain him with something else.	game/bank.rpy	1645	bi "[what]"
bank7_93343c06	bi	He's right to work, drawing something that looks like a... large chicken?	game/bank.rpy	1647	bi "[what]"
bank7_413a0a9d	bi	I'm amazed how cheerful this kid can stay, given everything.	game/bank.rpy	1648	bi "[what]"
bank7_c2244cc9	bi	I don't think I'd be able to handle all this trauma at his age.	game/bank.rpy	1649	bi "[what]"
bank7_97e50b13	bi	I... hope that doesn't mean he's used to it.	game/bank.rpy	1650	bi "[what]"
bank7_dab6cbea	bi	In any case, I should try to make myself useful.	game/bank.rpy	1651	bi "[what]"
bank7_ae2695b3	bi	Let's see...	game/bank.rpy	1652	bi "[what]"
bank7_70df193d	bi	There's some paper here.	game/bank.rpy	1653	bi "[what]"
bank7_d3cbe0b9	bi	So. Time to arrange some thoughts.	game/bank.rpy	1655	bi "[what]"
bank7_aac2eade	bi	We're learning more and more about how everyone is related.	game/bank.rpy	1656	bi "[what]"
bank7_6a983f9c	bi	Maybe mapping it all out can help me make a plan to keep everyone safe.	game/bank.rpy	1657	bi "[what]"
bank7_02f06dec	bi	I'll start by...	game/bank.rpy	1658	bi "[what]"
bank7_1a78f988	bi	Writing everyone out.	game/bank.rpy	1660	bi "[what]"
bank7_d5564ce0	bi	The twelve of us that we started with.	game/bank.rpy	1661	bi "[what]"
bank7_84734565	bi	And a spot in the middle for what might be tying us all together.	game/bank.rpy	1662	bi "[what]"
bank7_90a7c3a3	bi	Mr. Sydell.	game/bank.rpy	1664	bi "[what]"
bank7_a9b7fc76	bi	Too many of us have connections to him to ignore.	game/bank.rpy	1665	bi "[what]"
bank7_176ca040	bi	Alright. Freddy and Jenny.	game/bank.rpy	1666	bi "[what]"
bank7_2901d702	bi	Freddy's dad's case kinda sorta lead to Jenny's arrest.	game/bank.rpy	1668	bi "[what]"
bank7_1a3cd85b	bi	Jenny hates Freddy's dad, and maybe his dad knows about Jenny?	game/bank.rpy	1669	bi "[what]"
bank7_5b0f43cd	bi	Unfortunately, that's all we really know about them.	game/bank.rpy	1670	bi "[what]"
bank7_98583a50	bi	No direct connection to Mr. Sydell that we know of.	game/bank.rpy	1671	bi "[what]"
bank7_c373958f	bi	Next up is...	game/bank.rpy	1672	bi "[what]"
bank7_50a85efc	bi	Sid.	game/bank.rpy	1674	bi "[what]"
bank7_52472a55	bi	Sid got blackmailed into hacking InSyde Electronics, Mr. Sydell's company.	game/bank.rpy	1675	bi "[what]"
bank7_419902e9	bi	I don't think he's personally met Mr. Sydell, but there's a clear connection.	game/bank.rpy	1676	bi "[what]"
bank7_a181b3ef	bi	The same situation had him caught up with Shahar, pre-lobotomy.	game/bank.rpy	1677	bi "[what]"
bank7_8369b652	bi	Speaking of Shahar...	game/bank.rpy	1678	bi "[what]"
bank7_b6ba7002	bi	This is where it all starts to get messy.	game/bank.rpy	1680	bi "[what]"
bank7_9aea54dd	bi	Shahar, Ivan, and Stella were all pretty intertwined.	game/bank.rpy	1681	bi "[what]"
bank7_a756a80d	bi	Stella's company was suing Insyde.	game/bank.rpy	1682	bi "[what]"
bank7_6563c637	bi	Shahar was a lawyer hired to bring down Insyde Electronics.	game/bank.rpy	1683	bi "[what]"
bank7_5bcc33e4	bi	If Mr. Sydell is behind all this, it makes a lot of sense for them to be here...	game/bank.rpy	1684	bi "[what]"
bank7_b084a873	bi	And of course, Ivan is responsible for Shahar's lobotomy.	game/bank.rpy	1685	bi "[what]"
bank7_f8ceb104	bi	I don't think Stella had met either of them personally at the time, though.	game/bank.rpy	1686	bi "[what]"
bank7_773bf3ec	bi	I think that's the most complicated bit...	game/bank.rpy	1687	bi "[what]"
bank7_4270ec8e	bi	From there...	game/bank.rpy	1688	bi "[what]"
bank7_7d610680	bi	Catherine and Sam.	game/bank.rpy	1690	bi "[what]"
bank7_44ba0f39	bi	Both of them had been in Mr. Sydell's mansion before.	game/bank.rpy	1691	bi "[what]"
bank7_15fc88a7	bi	Catherine had robbed the place, in and out only one time.	game/bank.rpy	1692	bi "[what]"
bank7_5b316aa2	bi	Clear connection, but not much for us to go off of.	game/bank.rpy	1693	bi "[what]"
bank7_89819801	bi	Sam on the other hand had been there multiple times to sell him drugs.	game/bank.rpy	1694	bi "[what]"
bank7_25fc03c6	bi	And I think...	game/bank.rpy	1695	bi "[what]"
bank7_10bf2518	bi	That's all the prior connections.	game/bank.rpy	1697	bi "[what]"
bank7_33b6748e	bi	We don't have an clear connections between myself, Lauren, Dan, or Kaiser.	game/bank.rpy	1698	bi "[what]"
bank7_f764a75b	bi	Though, it's pretty easy to imagine how we could have upset Mr. Sydell...	game/bank.rpy	1699	bi "[what]"
bank7_0eb5d398	bi	Lauren and I have both accidentally... killed someone.	game/bank.rpy	1700	bi "[what]"
bank7_df660407	bi	They could have been people close to Mr. Sydell, or whoever the Game Master is.	game/bank.rpy	1701	bi "[what]"
bank7_4a861965	bi	Kaiser was responsible for a massive train heist, and Dan had just come from jail.	game/bank.rpy	1702	bi "[what]"
bank7_6b208859	bi	I'm sure we all have some type of relation, we just haven't uncovered everything yet.	game/bank.rpy	1703	bi "[what]"
bank7_e2d592fe	bi	Unfortunately, doing so will be hard...	game/bank.rpy	1704	bi "[what]"
bank7_398126cc	bi	...with six of us dead.	game/bank.rpy	1706	bi "[what]"
bank7_191012a5	bi	The only ones still alive with connections to Mr. Sydell are Sid and Sam.	game/bank.rpy	1707	bi "[what]"
bank7_05f665e2	bi	Sid's is pretty one sided though; it's not like he ever met Mr. Sydell.	game/bank.rpy	1708	bi "[what]"
bank7_0e78181d	bi	He just caused the company some trouble.	game/bank.rpy	1709	bi "[what]"
bank7_5f492876	bi	Sam, however...	game/bank.rpy	1710	bi "[what]"
bank7_a3583798	bi	...may have actually met Mr. Sydell.	game/bank.rpy	1712	bi "[what]"
bank7_7062948b	bi	We don't actually know the full extent of their relationship.	game/bank.rpy	1713	bi "[what]"
bank7_eddd85b7	bi	Maybe this is the missing link I've been ignoring!	game/bank.rpy	1714	bi "[what]"
bank7_a08431ce	bi	Sam might have useful information about Mr. Sydell, even if it's small.	game/bank.rpy	1715	bi "[what]"
bank7_c6ba2776	bi	Ever since Ivan's died, Sam's been struggling a bit, but has been helpful.	game/bank.rpy	1716	bi "[what]"
bank7_1a621f62	bi	I think they'd be supportive and tell me anything they could.	game/bank.rpy	1717	bi "[what]"
bank7_7c86c316	bi	Maybe this is a breakthrough!	game/bank.rpy	1718	bi "[what]"
bank7_4c8444ee	bi	I'll talk to Sam ASAP, and we'll all get out of here alive.	game/bank.rpy	1719	bi "[what]"
bank7_10500ceb	f	Hey Bert dad?	game/bank.rpy	1720	f "[what]"
bank7_c5de0e82	b	Oh! Freddy.	game/bank.rpy	1721	b "[what]"
bank7_7f6662dd	f	Bert, I wanna take a nap...	game/bank.rpy	1725	f "[what]"
bank7_22c20815	f	Can we go back to the sleeping room now?	game/bank.rpy	1726	f "[what]"
bank7_9bb88177	b	Yes, of course Freddy.	game/bank.rpy	1727	b "[what]"
bank7_64a70761	b	Thanks for hanging out with me Freddy, this time has been really helpful.	game/bank.rpy	1728	b "[what]"
bank7_bcdf0bcd	f	Huh?	game/bank.rpy	1729	f "[what]"
bank7_4912092a	f	My turkey was helpful, yay!	game/bank.rpy	1730	f "[what]"
bank7_a78b9ef9	b	Um... yeah!	game/bank.rpy	1731	b "[what]"
bank7_5158873a	b	Let's head back to the lobby.	game/bank.rpy	1732	b "[what]"
bank7_a5e04822	bi	He passed out almost instantly when we got back in here.	game/bank.rpy	1741	bi "[what]"
bank7_8894d290	bi	...I guess, Jenny's right, he is kinda cute.	game/bank.rpy	1742	bi "[what]"
bank7_f9838da5	bi	Anyway, it feels great having {i}some{/i} direction, however small.	game/bank.rpy	1743	bi "[what]"
bank7_2484f00d	bi	If Sam really can give us any new information about Mr. Sydell, we'd be in a good spot.	game/bank.rpy	1744	bi "[what]"
bank7_bbe71807	bi	I need to talk to Sam now.	game/bank.rpy	1745	bi "[what]"
bank7_9ff3aedc	bi	...But is it safe to leave Freddy alone?	game/bank.rpy	1746	bi "[what]"
bank7_7b6d8021	bi	Not like I can stop anyone from killing him, but I'll at least be a witness.	game/bank.rpy	1747	bi "[what]"
bank7_02736abf	bi	I could wait, but...	game/bank.rpy	1748	bi "[what]"
bank7_6fdf9ff5	bi	Every minute I spend not working on this mystery is a minute closer to someone else dying.	game/bank.rpy	1749	bi "[what]"
bank7_3adef8f3	bi	I have an idea...	game/bank.rpy	1750	bi "[what]"
bank7_bea4f1bb	bi	I approached the hallway door, and...	game/bank.rpy	1751	bi "[what]"
bank7_6fcbc06a	b	HEY!	game/bank.rpy	1752	b "[what]"
bank7_850ef128	b	...	game/bank.rpy	1753	b "[what]"
bank7_e036db51	b	Shoot, I was hoping someone would come...	game/bank.rpy	1754	b "[what]"
bank7_bc15a288	b	Maybe one more try...	game/bank.rpy	1755	b "[what]"
bank7_6fcbc06a_1	b	HEY!	game/bank.rpy	1756	b "[what]"
bank7_8b634e89	bi	A few seconds later...	game/bank.rpy	1757	bi "[what]"
bank7_351031bb	j	Bert! Is Freddy dead?	game/bank.rpy	1761	j "[what]"
bank7_35ba70ca	b	What?	game/bank.rpy	1762	b "[what]"
bank7_cd7e9137	j	You were yelling! I assumed you found a body...	game/bank.rpy	1763	j "[what]"
bank7_c28ceef7	b	Oh. Yeah, I guess that's a natural conclusion...	game/bank.rpy	1764	b "[what]"
bank7_73ba5c4a	b	No, I just wanted someone to take over Freddy duty.	game/bank.rpy	1765	b "[what]"
bank7_ab1be57e	j	Is there something you need to do?	game/bank.rpy	1766	j "[what]"
bank7_a7cc4622	bi	Hm... I need to be careful.	game/bank.rpy	1767	bi "[what]"
bank7_9218f769	bi	It might not be a good idea to broadcast that I'm talking to Sam...	game/bank.rpy	1768	bi "[what]"
bank7_b4176b50	b	I uh, need to use the bathroom.	game/bank.rpy	1769	b "[what]"
bank7_c6f3ae7d	j	Oh. Yeah, makes sense, nature calls and all that.	game/bank.rpy	1770	j "[what]"
bank7_91b6c56c	b	Also, do you know where Sam is?	game/bank.rpy	1771	b "[what]"
bank7_9fbca821	j	Huh?	game/bank.rpy	1772	j "[what]"
bank7_80180b70	j	Why do you need to know where Sam is to use the bathroom?	game/bank.rpy	1773	j "[what]"
bank7_7a3b7a11	b	Um...	game/bank.rpy	1774	b "[what]"
bank7_1343c9ca	bi	Shoot, I blew it.	game/bank.rpy	1775	bi "[what]"
bank7_2d3eba1e	bi	Quick, I need an excuse...	game/bank.rpy	1776	bi "[what]"
bank7_92fb3c77	b	Sam has shy bladder syndrome!	game/bank.rpy	1777	b "[what]"
bank7_9fbca821_1	j	Huh?	game/bank.rpy	1778	j "[what]"
bank7_50ce89b3	b	If anyone is even near the bathroom Sam has trouble... you know...	game/bank.rpy	1779	b "[what]"
bank7_8fe76c6f	b	So I didn't want to inter-	game/bank.rpy	1780	b "[what]"
bank7_bb26377d	j	Bert...	game/bank.rpy	1781	j "[what]"
bank7_890be04e	j	You could've just made something up.	game/bank.rpy	1782	j "[what]"
bank7_125ca4d9	j	Just go, I'll look over Freddy.	game/bank.rpy	1783	j "[what]"
bank7_141647c6	bi	How is it that the most awkward conversations of my life happen while I'm at risk of death...	game/bank.rpy	1784	bi "[what]"
bank7_e11c4dea	b	Great, thanks Jenny!	game/bank.rpy	1785	b "[what]"
bank7_1d7adbab	bi	I ran off before she could respond.	game/bank.rpy	1787	bi "[what]"
bank7_db6027b5	bi	After searching for a bit, I found Sam.	game/bank.rpy	1792	bi "[what]"
bank7_7e0d8bfa	s	Bert, you look like someone spilled red paint on your cheeks.	game/bank.rpy	1795	s "[what]"
bank7_b5a4bf66	b	I uh... let's not talk about it.	game/bank.rpy	1796	b "[what]"
bank7_735394ef	s	Out of shape?	game/bank.rpy	1797	s "[what]"
bank7_387ba602	b	Something like that...	game/bank.rpy	1798	b "[what]"
bank7_d19aa813	bi	Sid is sleeping on the couch... we should really talk in private.	game/bank.rpy	1799	bi "[what]"
bank7_ea0bf548	b	Hey, can I talk to you in the office? Just us two?	game/bank.rpy	1800	b "[what]"
bank7_327a50ea	s	Sure.	game/bank.rpy	1801	s "[what]"
bank7_bd3d108e	b	You're really going along with this that easily?	game/bank.rpy	1802	b "[what]"
bank7_b579833d	s	I asked you to do the same earlier.	game/bank.rpy	1803	s "[what]"
bank7_444ba096	s	Besides, I'm not the one who's out of shape.	game/bank.rpy	1804	s "[what]"
bank7_d0a8e337	s	I think I can handle myself just fine against you.	game/bank.rpy	1805	s "[what]"
bank7_1b3c85a6	bi	I should be offended but now's not really the time...	game/bank.rpy	1806	bi "[what]"
bank7_edba1306	b	Okay, let's talk before anyone sees us...	game/bank.rpy	1807	b "[what]"
bank7_554db4f4	s	So, did you find anything?	game/bank.rpy	1813	s "[what]"
bank7_a88c8b9f	b	No, but... I realized something.	game/bank.rpy	1814	b "[what]"
bank7_1398e063	b	Something you haven't told us much about...	game/bank.rpy	1815	b "[what]"
bank7_ace535d5	b	Your relationship with Mr. Sydell.	game/bank.rpy	1816	b "[what]"
bank7_d94a2479	b	And more generally, any information about him that could help us.	game/bank.rpy	1817	b "[what]"
bank7_7a822d11	s	That's because there's nothing to tell.	game/bank.rpy	1818	s "[what]"
bank7_faf31508	s	It was strictly a business relationship.	game/bank.rpy	1819	s "[what]"
bank7_511b0ac5	b	But surely you knew something about the guy!	game/bank.rpy	1820	b "[what]"
bank7_897d9d55	b	Aren't you supposed to build rapport with customers?	game/bank.rpy	1821	b "[what]"
bank7_d8ad80ad	s	What do you think I am, a mom and pop shop?	game/bank.rpy	1822	s "[what]"
bank7_818fd8a1	s	It's drugs Bert, the product does all the selling.	game/bank.rpy	1823	s "[what]"
bank7_c0774ebb	s	Not to mention, it's not exactly a good idea to tell a drug dealer about your personal life.	game/bank.rpy	1824	s "[what]"
bank7_2071965c	s	You ever watch Oughta Holler at Paul?	game/bank.rpy	1825	s "[what]"
bank7_b63f1d41	b	Oughta Holler at Paul?	game/bank.rpy	1826	b "[what]"
bank7_6bb23e55	s	It's a show about everyday crime, and the main character, Paul, is a lawyer.	game/bank.rpy	1827	s "[what]"
bank7_8bc7e1a9	b	...Why should you holler at a lawyer?	game/bank.rpy	1828	b "[what]"
bank7_2d88d481	s	It's meant to rhyme. Holl, Paul.	game/bank.rpy	1829	s "[what]"
bank7_b9fe01f5	b	Wouldn't it be better as Oughta Call Paul?	game/bank.rpy	1830	b "[what]"
bank7_8281eb25	b	So that Call and Paul actually rhyme?	game/bank.rpy	1831	b "[what]"
bank7_20019765	b	Also who says "Oughta" these days?	game/bank.rpy	1832	b "[what]"
bank7_62122890	b	I think instead I'd say Bet-	game/bank.rpy	1833	b "[what]"
bank7_430e700f	s	Whoa whoa, that's trademarked.	game/bank.rpy	1834	s "[what]"
bank7_82caff76	s	Anyway, yeah, Oughta Holler at Paul.	game/bank.rpy	1835	s "[what]"
bank7_277f470f	s	There's a guy smuggling pills to the local cartel.	game/bank.rpy	1836	s "[what]"
bank7_472836bd	s	One day he gets too relaxed and they find his address...	game/bank.rpy	1837	s "[what]"
bank7_3baad3cf	s	Next thing he knows, he's getting robbed.	game/bank.rpy	1838	s "[what]"
bank7_5e4c84f6	s	You don't mix personal and professional.	game/bank.rpy	1839	s "[what]"
bank7_2b12a8ba	b	Yeah but... I don't get the sense you'd rob anyone.	game/bank.rpy	1840	b "[what]"
bank7_96af23a6	s	You barely know me. And Sydell arguably knew me even less.	game/bank.rpy	1841	s "[what]"
bank7_3230595f	s	He'd be a fool to let me know who his family was, where he lived, anything like that.	game/bank.rpy	1842	s "[what]"
bank7_8d65c5ff	b	Wait, but I thought you'd been to his house?	game/bank.rpy	1843	b "[what]"
bank7_32a1d2df	s	I never said that.	game/bank.rpy	1844	s "[what]"
bank7_c4ced0f7	b	But you knew where we were!	game/bank.rpy	1845	b "[what]"
bank7_bf9bdd8b	s	Yes.	game/bank.rpy	1846	s "[what]"
bank7_3b11b1c9	s	Because of the big painting of the guy I'd met in the living room.	game/bank.rpy	1847	s "[what]"
bank7_1bfe4030	b	...Oh.	game/bank.rpy	1848	b "[what]"
bank7_4ff73a93	s	I must say...	game/bank.rpy	1849	s "[what]"
bank7_72f993bc	s	I'm trying to be less snappy and more nice but...	game/bank.rpy	1850	s "[what]"
bank7_4c768f34	s	Things like this make it hard.	game/bank.rpy	1851	s "[what]"
bank7_f57eca5c	b	Sorry, I guess the questions are annoying.	game/bank.rpy	1852	b "[what]"
bank7_4216e84e	s	No, not that.	game/bank.rpy	1853	s "[what]"
bank7_7a33d818	s	I mean, yes, that's annoying.	game/bank.rpy	1854	s "[what]"
bank7_49b16ee7	s	But... remembering my past.	game/bank.rpy	1855	s "[what]"
bank7_2a52c9d8	s	The sort of exterior I had to put on to get through my job.	game/bank.rpy	1856	s "[what]"
bank7_20184067	s	I used to be such an optimistic person until I went to my first protest.	game/bank.rpy	1857	s "[what]"
bank7_71c8e095	b	What happened there?	game/bank.rpy	1858	b "[what]"
bank7_3f46d42f	s	...I don't want to relive it.	game/bank.rpy	1859	s "[what]"
bank7_93bbd414	s	It's not relevant to any of this, anyway.	game/bank.rpy	1860	s "[what]"
bank7_f5117f20	bi	Sam doesn't want to relive it...	game/bank.rpy	1861	bi "[what]"
bank7_b0e48533	bi	A moment that was probably tragic and took part of Sam's soul away...	game/bank.rpy	1862	bi "[what]"
bank7_6bc00eb5	bi	That's all too familiar.	game/bank.rpy	1863	bi "[what]"
bank7_8c87834d	b	What if we traded stories?	game/bank.rpy	1864	b "[what]"
bank7_dc1cd401	s	Hm?	game/bank.rpy	1865	s "[what]"
bank7_4049b655	b	I tell you about the day I committed my crime, and...	game/bank.rpy	1866	b "[what]"
bank7_b15d6743	b	You tell me about this protest?	game/bank.rpy	1867	b "[what]"
bank7_e1554201	s	...	game/bank.rpy	1868	s "[what]"
bank7_fae4b7f2	s	I don't like that you're making a business transaction out of it.	game/bank.rpy	1869	s "[what]"
bank7_90a9ecfd	b	No, no, it's not that.	game/bank.rpy	1870	b "[what]"
bank7_3c41eebf	b	I could relate to what you said.	game/bank.rpy	1871	b "[what]"
bank7_f1cadb32	b	You don't want to relive it.	game/bank.rpy	1872	b "[what]"
bank7_cfca0cfd	s	If you don't want to relive your moment, why are you offering to share it?	game/bank.rpy	1873	s "[what]"
bank7_ce572f3d	s	And why would you ask me to relive mine, knowing that feeling?	game/bank.rpy	1874	s "[what]"
bank7_17a37a0e	s	When you were talking to Dracula in the hospital you couldn't do it.	game/bank.rpy	1875	s "[what]"
bank7_7db6285a	s	Even when it would get you a favor from Dracula.	game/bank.rpy	1876	s "[what]"
bank7_79261983	s	You're calculating Bert. Just like me.	game/bank.rpy	1877	s "[what]"
bank7_b0e21b2b	s	If you wouldn't do it then when there was something to gain...	game/bank.rpy	1878	s "[what]"
bank7_f63c78e9	s	Why would you do it now?	game/bank.rpy	1879	s "[what]"
bank7_c365e970	b	I don't know, I guess...	game/bank.rpy	1880	b "[what]"
bank7_7c85b8af	b	I knew thinking about it and processing it would help me move on.	game/bank.rpy	1881	b "[what]"
bank7_2000c5eb	b	But I didn't want to talk about it, because it made me feel like a bad person.	game/bank.rpy	1882	b "[what]"
bank7_52cca6f9	b	Just... knowing how much negative impact I could have on someone else's life.	game/bank.rpy	1883	b "[what]"
bank7_c6af82e4	b	Yet... I don't know, I think hearing that someone else went through something...	game/bank.rpy	1884	b "[what]"
bank7_0cc9ccb8	b	Well, even remotely similar to me.	game/bank.rpy	1885	b "[what]"
bank7_0b6ac880	b	It feels hypocritical.	game/bank.rpy	1886	b "[what]"
bank7_507477ac	b	To want others to push through their trauma but not want to push through mine.	game/bank.rpy	1887	b "[what]"
bank7_e1554201_1	s	...	game/bank.rpy	1888	s "[what]"
bank7_850ef128_1	b	...	game/bank.rpy	1889	b "[what]"
bank7_790d33f9	bi	I can't tell if Sam is emotional or just thinks I'm an idiot right now.	game/bank.rpy	1890	bi "[what]"
bank7_e1554201_2	s	...	game/bank.rpy	1891	s "[what]"
bank7_332db788	s	...If you're playing me right here, I'll never forgive you.	game/bank.rpy	1892	s "[what]"
bank7_b6c0a54e	b	I swear I-	game/bank.rpy	1893	b "[what]"
bank7_20080f33	s	I'm convinced.	game/bank.rpy	1894	s "[what]"
bank7_c4324d15	s	You mean it.	game/bank.rpy	1895	s "[what]"
bank7_83cef12f	s	I'm not sure if I agree with it or even get it, but you're not manipulating me.	game/bank.rpy	1896	s "[what]"
bank7_9da3d7c4	s	But it's not worth our time right now to talk about things that aren't directly related to this.	game/bank.rpy	1897	s "[what]"
bank7_83f91b94	s	If... no, when we get out of here, we can go grab a drink and {i}talk about our feelings{/i}.	game/bank.rpy	1898	s "[what]"
bank7_5bf2cc46	bi	Sam said that in the manner of a bratty teenager who was playing on their phone.	game/bank.rpy	1899	bi "[what]"
bank7_867c5518	bi	But I think it was less derision and moreso a desire to get to business.	game/bank.rpy	1900	bi "[what]"
bank7_28cc3946	s	There's a few things I... learned about Mr. Sydell.	game/bank.rpy	1901	s "[what]"
bank7_b5c90eb7	s	I don't know if they're relevant but I'll tell you them.	game/bank.rpy	1902	s "[what]"
bank7_6d992c6c	s	Drug dealing is not like what you see in crime dramas.	game/bank.rpy	1903	s "[what]"
bank7_c9f2c700	s	Not every user is a junkie in a dirty apartment.	game/bank.rpy	1904	s "[what]"
bank7_00e5aece	b	Oh, I never-	game/bank.rpy	1905	b "[what]"
bank7_5397706a	s	You don't need to lie and say that wasn't your stereotype.	game/bank.rpy	1906	s "[what]"
bank7_b40ce103	b	Hey, how do you know I don't use drugs?	game/bank.rpy	1907	b "[what]"
bank7_74691cf5	b	Aren't you stereotyping me?	game/bank.rpy	1908	b "[what]"
bank7_0454a5a0	s	Do you use drugs?	game/bank.rpy	1909	s "[what]"
bank7_c659d793	b	...No...	game/bank.rpy	1910	b "[what]"
bank7_34e1c7f2	s	Anyway.	game/bank.rpy	1911	s "[what]"
bank7_8cfa00fe	s	"Drug user" is too wide-reaching of a term, really.	game/bank.rpy	1912	s "[what]"
bank7_d0708ac8	s	Sydell wasn't the only rich man in a suit we did business with.	game/bank.rpy	1913	s "[what]"
bank7_681440d6	s	In some sense rich men in suits are the ideal customer for a drug dealer.	game/bank.rpy	1914	s "[what]"
bank7_49a8857d	s	Most businessmen break the rules one way or another in their jobs.	game/bank.rpy	1915	s "[what]"
bank7_cf458ce9	s	To them, law is moreso a guideline than a rule.	game/bank.rpy	1916	s "[what]"
bank7_4e8363de	s	They have a reputation to uphold, so they have an interest in keeping things quiet.	game/bank.rpy	1917	s "[what]"
bank7_d18f6faa	s	Plus, they obviously have money.	game/bank.rpy	1918	s "[what]"
bank7_7a6ce1b6	s	And they'll pay more for high quality.	game/bank.rpy	1919	s "[what]"
bank7_82976acc	s	And they're often buying for a whole party, not just themselves.	game/bank.rpy	1920	s "[what]"
bank7_255e1cf0	s	Anyway, I wasn't lying when I said most of my customers treat it as a professional relationship.	game/bank.rpy	1921	s "[what]"
bank7_69bebe36	b	...Most, meaning...	game/bank.rpy	1922	b "[what]"
bank7_ac18aec4	s	Yeah. Not all.	game/bank.rpy	1923	s "[what]"
bank7_3655042f	s	Sydell was one of those exceptions.	game/bank.rpy	1924	s "[what]"
bank7_7fa238a3	s	We original kept a very professional relationship and he genuinely told me nothing.	game/bank.rpy	1925	s "[what]"
bank7_a45ce3bf	s	But he gradually started deteriorating one day.	game/bank.rpy	1926	s "[what]"
bank7_117dd640	b	Deteriorating?	game/bank.rpy	1927	b "[what]"
bank7_9f4fa109	s	Yeah, it's kind of hard to explain.	game/bank.rpy	1928	s "[what]"
bank7_eecfc8ad	s	It's not like he suddenly changed.	game/bank.rpy	1929	s "[what]"
bank7_d09db4af	s	But one day he started trying to make small talk.	game/bank.rpy	1930	s "[what]"
bank7_b94c70d8	s	I didn't recriprocate.	game/bank.rpy	1931	s "[what]"
bank7_68d9129b	s	I'm not exactly the most social type of person.	game/bank.rpy	1932	s "[what]"
bank7_7bcbf1f7	bi	Sam? Not social?	game/bank.rpy	1933	bi "[what]"
bank7_3198c8f2	bi	Not... the most surprising.	game/bank.rpy	1934	bi "[what]"
bank7_a8b7a137	s	I didn't think much of it.	game/bank.rpy	1935	s "[what]"
bank7_cd7d0797	s	Thought maybe he just warmed up to me.	game/bank.rpy	1936	s "[what]"
bank7_6448e57c	s	Business types, they're good conversationalists.	game/bank.rpy	1937	s "[what]"
bank7_7d77b2aa	s	They're also a bit eccentric.	game/bank.rpy	1938	s "[what]"
bank7_e4e656d1	s	So I didn't think anything of it.	game/bank.rpy	1939	s "[what]"
bank7_18dde569	s	But eventually he started letting things slip that made it clear...	game/bank.rpy	1940	s "[what]"
bank7_da06b7c2	s	Something was going wrong in his life.	game/bank.rpy	1941	s "[what]"
bank7_3340d81b	b	The lawsuit with Stella's company?	game/bank.rpy	1942	b "[what]"
bank7_a3377081	s	Maybe.	game/bank.rpy	1943	s "[what]"
bank7_dfdca847	s	His company wasn't large enough for the lawsuit to make the mainstream media.	game/bank.rpy	1944	s "[what]"
bank7_0f103df1	s	So I don't know when that happened.	game/bank.rpy	1945	s "[what]"
bank7_882b5db3	s	I guess we can interrogate him after this.	game/bank.rpy	1946	s "[what]"
bank7_212d05f5	s	Anyway, yeah, from my point of view, not knowing about the lawsuit...	game/bank.rpy	1947	s "[what]"
bank7_a23a5412	s	It just seemed like Sydell's family life was getting worse but I didn't know why.	game/bank.rpy	1948	s "[what]"
bank7_b42f6f1a	s	He mentioned a few different things on different days that I didn't put together until later.	game/bank.rpy	1949	s "[what]"
bank7_62ee15ac	s	One, he asked me not to tell his wife about what we were doing.	game/bank.rpy	1950	s "[what]"
bank7_de75f9ae	s	Which was weird, because I didn't know his wife at all.	game/bank.rpy	1951	s "[what]"
bank7_f4e2ce29	s	Two, his wife was in the hospital.	game/bank.rpy	1952	s "[what]"
bank7_bced451a	s	And three, that his "obnoxious brother-in-law" wanted him to lose custody of his kid.	game/bank.rpy	1953	s "[what]"
bank7_b8e7465f	b	Sydell had a kid...	game/bank.rpy	1954	b "[what]"
bank7_f533c633	b	I guess we could've guessed that from his mansion.	game/bank.rpy	1955	b "[what]"
bank7_cdbc6982	b	It definitely had more rooms than one man, or even one couple, could need.	game/bank.rpy	1956	b "[what]"
bank7_13da438c	b	...Sam, did he mention the gender of the kid?	game/bank.rpy	1957	b "[what]"
bank7_4ceed021	s	No... why do you ask?	game/bank.rpy	1958	s "[what]"
bank7_a642ab59	b	Well, could Sydell have been Gerald Ogden's actual name?	game/bank.rpy	1959	b "[what]"
bank7_c642d44f	b	And maybe Freddy was the kid that he was going to lose custody of.	game/bank.rpy	1960	b "[what]"
bank7_60cde310	b	It would make sense, if Freddy's mom went into the hospital.	game/bank.rpy	1961	b "[what]"
bank7_516952b7	b	His dad sounded somewhat negligent, so someone had to step in.	game/bank.rpy	1962	b "[what]"
bank7_64d77f29	s	...Bert, that's a stupid theory.	game/bank.rpy	1963	s "[what]"
bank7_3687d3e6	s	I met Sydell and I saw Gerald Ogden's face.	game/bank.rpy	1964	s "[what]"
bank7_ee29a7e9	s	They look totally different.	game/bank.rpy	1965	s "[what]"
bank7_a9ca9f9a	b	Oh...	game/bank.rpy	1966	b "[what]"
bank7_030cfd46	b	Right...	game/bank.rpy	1967	b "[what]"
bank7_b2337a6b	b	...I dunno, maybe he got cosmetic surgery?	game/bank.rpy	1968	b "[what]"
bank7_29b10d30	b	Assume a new identity, get a fresh start at life, that sort of thing?	game/bank.rpy	1969	b "[what]"
bank7_83b8ee38	s	That's a bit of a stretch.	game/bank.rpy	1970	s "[what]"
bank7_3136a119	b	Hm... yeah.	game/bank.rpy	1971	b "[what]"
bank7_850ef128_2	b	...	game/bank.rpy	1972	b "[what]"
bank7_de5a75ac	b	Earlier you mentioned something.	game/bank.rpy	1973	b "[what]"
bank7_414b4b2a	b	Sydell mysteriously disappeared as a customer, three years ago.	game/bank.rpy	1974	b "[what]"
bank7_8d7fbd64	s	Yeah, what of it?	game/bank.rpy	1975	s "[what]"
bank7_8443319c	b	...How close was this to when he started deteriorating?	game/bank.rpy	1976	b "[what]"
bank7_501e87a3	b	Like, a few weeks, a few months?	game/bank.rpy	1977	b "[what]"
bank7_b017d082	s	I'd say it was a few months.	game/bank.rpy	1978	s "[what]"
bank7_ccd85aa5	b	So the point when he started deteriorating was also roughly three years ago.	game/bank.rpy	1979	b "[what]"
bank7_d6736551	s	Yeah, I guess.	game/bank.rpy	1980	s "[what]"
bank7_7815fe33	b	...Did he say what type of hospital his wife was in?	game/bank.rpy	1981	b "[what]"
bank7_b3f2bd64	s	...You think...	game/bank.rpy	1982	s "[what]"
bank7_411b9f77	b	She might have been on the missing composite in the mental hospital, yeah.	game/bank.rpy	1983	b "[what]"
bank7_fb74d7bc	b	Maybe she and Shahar even crossed paths.	game/bank.rpy	1984	b "[what]"
bank7_20779d7a	s	You don't think Shahar would remember the name Sydell?	game/bank.rpy	1985	s "[what]"
bank7_38147c51	b	Also...	game/bank.rpy	1986	b "[what]"
bank7_7264c9ab	b	If the lawsuit is what caused him to deteriorate...	game/bank.rpy	1987	b "[what]"
bank7_0bea9647	b	Doesn't that mean it happened roughly three years ago?	game/bank.rpy	1988	b "[what]"
bank7_f0b47bed	s	Yeah, that'd make sense.	game/bank.rpy	1989	s "[what]"
bank7_f5e271d5	b	But in the hospital, when we were trying to figure out the missing composite...	game/bank.rpy	1990	b "[what]"
bank7_7466d7a6	b	Everyone said they hadn't committed a crime in the last three years except you.	game/bank.rpy	1991	b "[what]"
bank7_eda471e0	s	...You think Sid and Dracula were lying?	game/bank.rpy	1992	s "[what]"
bank7_01a0f180	b	I mean, Dracula might have been.	game/bank.rpy	1993	b "[what]"
bank7_4561903a	b	He had reason to disassociate himself with the location.	game/bank.rpy	1994	b "[what]"
bank7_b29b3cc5	s	But Sid?	game/bank.rpy	1995	s "[what]"
bank7_69a61f74	s	That twerp, I swear...	game/bank.rpy	1996	s "[what]"
bank7_84453127	bi	It was kind of refreshing to hear Sam call Sid a twerp.	game/bank.rpy	1997	bi "[what]"
bank7_6815e8d2	bi	It was almost like... an old friend had returned.	game/bank.rpy	1998	bi "[what]"
bank7_bf7bde73	bi	I guess the grass is always greener on the other side, or something like that.	game/bank.rpy	1999	bi "[what]"
bank7_6c3375cf	b	We can go ask him.	game/bank.rpy	2000	b "[what]"
bank7_7c6f7806	b	I feel like I have a ton of unanswered questions now...	game/bank.rpy	2001	b "[what]"
bank7_47e67b52	s	You didn't before?	game/bank.rpy	2002	s "[what]"
bank7_fd94eff5	b	Well, a ton of new ones.	game/bank.rpy	2003	b "[what]"
bank7_20d6be32	s	Such as?	game/bank.rpy	2004	s "[what]"
bank7_7a881233	b	When did the lawsuit happen?	game/bank.rpy	2005	b "[what]"
bank7_41c39eb1	b	Are Sydell's wife and kid related to this at all?	game/bank.rpy	2006	b "[what]"
bank7_509900d3	b	And Dracula's theory is Mr. Sydell is running the game.	game/bank.rpy	2007	b "[what]"
bank7_2563eba8	b	But if he disappeared from your life, and he was spiralling mentally when he did...	game/bank.rpy	2008	b "[what]"
bank7_510b8c3f	b	Is he even in shape to run this game?	game/bank.rpy	2009	b "[what]"
bank7_5f661ff2	b	Or... is that why he's crazy enough to run this game?	game/bank.rpy	2010	b "[what]"
bank7_b9479f32	b	And if not him, who is running this game?	game/bank.rpy	2011	b "[what]"
bank7_8a0f4223	b	And what's their connection to him?	game/bank.rpy	2012	b "[what]"
bank7_e3714886	s	So... if you have all these new questions, this conversation wasn't helpful then?	game/bank.rpy	2013	s "[what]"
bank7_213df2cb	b	No, it was good.	game/bank.rpy	2014	b "[what]"
bank7_65dd66f5	b	It's like when you start out playing a video game, you go through the tutorial.	game/bank.rpy	2015	b "[what]"
bank7_d2074837	b	You only have one thing to do, beat the tutorial.	game/bank.rpy	2016	b "[what]"
bank7_885c6681	b	But then once you unlock the rest of the game there's all these lingering things to do.	game/bank.rpy	2017	b "[what]"
bank7_7e5ec062	b	But just because you have more things you could be doing, it doesn't mean you didn't make progress.	game/bank.rpy	2018	b "[what]"
bank7_bd543ad4	s	...Nerd.	game/bank.rpy	2019	s "[what]"
bank7_59a4c6c3	bi	...Yeah, I kind of deserved that one.	game/bank.rpy	2020	bi "[what]"
bank7_a2651db6	b	Anyway, this was helpful.	game/bank.rpy	2021	b "[what]"
bank7_698c77f8	s	You're welcome, I guess.	game/bank.rpy	2022	s "[what]"
bank7_4729e8af	s	Sorry for not saying any of this earlier.	game/bank.rpy	2023	s "[what]"
bank7_7e9ff111	b	No, I get it...	game/bank.rpy	2024	b "[what]"
bank7_92f2d227	b	Don't want to put a target on your back.	game/bank.rpy	2025	b "[what]"
bank7_19e97698	b	And until recently the connections to Mr. Sydell were... slim.	game/bank.rpy	2026	b "[what]"
bank7_a98e308c	s	Whatever, let's go make Sid open up about those emails he planted.	game/bank.rpy	2027	s "[what]"
bank7_f02dd8e9	bi	It didn't take long for us to find Sid...	game/bank.rpy	2035	bi "[what]"
bank7_0042c5ea	bi	He'd spent most of his time in here in one of two places.	game/bank.rpy	2036	bi "[what]"
bank7_6e13fb4f	bi	Napping on the couch, or...	game/bank.rpy	2037	bi "[what]"
bank7_a759a556	bi	In front of the safe.	game/bank.rpy	2040	bi "[what]"
bank7_2d114219	i	Hm... maybe the scratches on the surface of the vault mean something...	game/bank.rpy	2041	i "[what]"
bank7_e8261c7b	s	What are you doing?	game/bank.rpy	2042	s "[what]"
bank7_ab83bd0a	i	Sam? Bert?	game/bank.rpy	2043	i "[what]"
bank7_b623a58d	i	What are you doing here?	game/bank.rpy	2044	i "[what]"
bank7_384c08b7	s	That's what I just asked you.	game/bank.rpy	2045	s "[what]"
bank7_019551b2	i	What does it look like?	game/bank.rpy	2046	i "[what]"
bank7_a0fff21d	i	I'm trying to open the safe!	game/bank.rpy	2047	i "[what]"
bank7_5d31ac01	s	...The one that we said would be a bad idea to mess with.	game/bank.rpy	2048	s "[what]"
bank7_474498ea	i	You think I'm gunna listen to some loser adults?	game/bank.rpy	2049	i "[what]"
bank7_c29babb5	s	You understand the part where you die if you get it wrong, right?	game/bank.rpy	2050	s "[what]"
bank7_f9fac821	i	I'm not stupid, Sam.	game/bank.rpy	2051	i "[what]"
bank7_d2ac335f	i	Just because I didn't go to school as much as I should have, doesn't mean I can't read.	game/bank.rpy	2052	i "[what]"
bank7_e377bf64	i	I'm smart enough to be the next William Fences!	game/bank.rpy	2053	i "[what]"
bank7_0fe3de16	i	The next Elon Odor!	game/bank.rpy	2054	i "[what]"
bank7_6a26bfb2	i	The next Mark Zuckermountain!	game/bank.rpy	2055	i "[what]"
bank7_cb627699	bi	I didn't realize it until Sid mentioned the famous software CEOs, but...	game/bank.rpy	2056	bi "[what]"
bank7_3f8b5207	bi	They all have very stupid names.	game/bank.rpy	2057	bi "[what]"
bank7_3faaa6d6	s	You might have the technical smarts, but...	game/bank.rpy	2058	s "[what]"
bank7_b76607a6	s	Your street smarts are a bit lacking.	game/bank.rpy	2059	s "[what]"
bank7_22992d43	bi	The downside to Sam recovering from "killing" Stella was, well...	game/bank.rpy	2060	bi "[what]"
bank7_d77f7f54	bi	Sam and Sid didn't get along.	game/bank.rpy	2061	bi "[what]"
bank7_75d43b2e	bi	This might cause us more problems if I don't-	game/bank.rpy	2062	bi "[what]"
bank7_ffb6489a	i	...You don't understand.	game/bank.rpy	2063	i "[what]"
bank7_7e79d90d	i	You never could unless you lived a day in my life.	game/bank.rpy	2064	i "[what]"
bank7_7fa22726	b	...Understand what?	game/bank.rpy	2065	b "[what]"
bank7_ec7e639b	i	If this game ended right now and you went back to your normal lives...	game/bank.rpy	2066	i "[what]"
bank7_fc2ac4c9	i	What would you do tomorrow?	game/bank.rpy	2067	i "[what]"
bank7_5089c8fd	b	I guess... call my loved ones and let them know I'm okay...	game/bank.rpy	2068	b "[what]"
bank7_3898a725	b	Then probably make sure I have a job still and if so catch up on work.	game/bank.rpy	2069	b "[what]"
bank7_df459d34	s	I'm sure if I explained to the dean I could drop all my classes and retake them later.	game/bank.rpy	2070	s "[what]"
bank7_5d8642bc	i	See, you have... hopeful lives to get back to.	game/bank.rpy	2071	i "[what]"
bank7_902a8fcf	i	If I make it out of here, I'm still poor.	game/bank.rpy	2072	i "[what]"
bank7_25acd83d	i	My family still has a mountain of debt to climb out of.	game/bank.rpy	2073	i "[what]"
bank7_86047284	i	My parents might... might...	game/bank.rpy	2074	i "[what]"
bank7_50f496a8	bi	He was visibly tearing up.	game/bank.rpy	2075	bi "[what]"
bank7_67360d1e	b	Sid... that was inconsiderate of us to answer to quickly.	game/bank.rpy	2076	b "[what]"
bank7_47e9bb2a	i	No it's...	game/bank.rpy	2077	i "[what]"
bank7_eed6c367	i	I'm sure for people like you it's a reasonable answer.	game/bank.rpy	2078	i "[what]"
bank7_3225da5c	i	And for people like you it's also probably reasonable to ignore this safe.	game/bank.rpy	2079	i "[what]"
bank7_f1537a1e	i	But... for me?	game/bank.rpy	2080	i "[what]"
bank7_6682b659	i	That brief moment in the mansion where I just got to eat a bunch of food.	game/bank.rpy	2081	i "[what]"
bank7_192f6958	i	Even though we were in a deadly game.	game/bank.rpy	2082	i "[what]"
bank7_b144ecb5	i	Even though Stella died shortly after...	game/bank.rpy	2083	i "[what]"
bank7_3c28f962	i	I got to pretend my problems outside of here didn't exist for a bit.	game/bank.rpy	2084	i "[what]"
bank7_4e1af5f3	i	But that made me realize something.	game/bank.rpy	2085	i "[what]"
bank7_13925b8f	i	My life isn't much better if I escape.	game/bank.rpy	2086	i "[what]"
bank7_5716d5d1	i	So yeah, maybe it gets me killed.	game/bank.rpy	2087	i "[what]"
bank7_a6da4c7f	i	But... if there's even a slight chance.	game/bank.rpy	2088	i "[what]"
bank7_4cfd62ed	i	That I can not just get out of here, but make everything alright for my family...	game/bank.rpy	2089	i "[what]"
bank7_d7d33bc7	i	I have to go for it.	game/bank.rpy	2090	i "[what]"
bank7_850ef128_3	b	...	game/bank.rpy	2091	b "[what]"
bank7_e1554201_3	s	...	game/bank.rpy	2092	s "[what]"
bank7_e843b489	bi	Sometimes when people make a big mistake they don't want to admit it.	game/bank.rpy	2093	bi "[what]"
bank7_d2fb9be2	bi	But it's clear from looking at them that they know.	game/bank.rpy	2094	bi "[what]"
bank7_e8fc7dca	bi	Sam had that look.	game/bank.rpy	2095	bi "[what]"
bank7_68f41f01	b	Sid...	game/bank.rpy	2096	b "[what]"
bank7_e17d2634	b	Obviously my approval doesn't matter much to you.	game/bank.rpy	2097	b "[what]"
bank7_acbd4be2	b	I can't relate to what you've gone through.	game/bank.rpy	2098	b "[what]"
bank7_ac3de0e1	b	But... I won't judge you for trying to get whatever's in there.	game/bank.rpy	2099	b "[what]"
bank7_e620d995	b	And I don't think Sam will either.	game/bank.rpy	2100	b "[what]"
bank7_0adf0e86	bi	That was more of an order to Sam than trying to be supportive of Sid.	game/bank.rpy	2101	bi "[what]"
bank7_4d488ad7	s	Hmph.	game/bank.rpy	2102	s "[what]"
bank7_d710c92b	bi	I did want to tell Sid that, at the same time, it wasn't just his life at stake here.	game/bank.rpy	2103	bi "[what]"
bank7_e9a28a94	bi	And as sorry as I felt for him...	game/bank.rpy	2104	bi "[what]"
bank7_8ddf64c7	bi	Him risking his life to open this safe indirectly endangered all of us.	game/bank.rpy	2105	bi "[what]"
bank7_6a69a8aa	bi	If he died because someone tricked him into trying to open the safe.	game/bank.rpy	2106	bi "[what]"
bank7_dc1dc21a	bi	And worse, if we couldn't figure out who...	game/bank.rpy	2107	bi "[what]"
bank7_c503b8b2	bi	We'd all die as well.	game/bank.rpy	2108	bi "[what]"
bank7_5e212415	bi	Maybe I should have told him that but...	game/bank.rpy	2109	bi "[what]"
bank7_c1be98a4	bi	So far he hadn't tried it.	game/bank.rpy	2110	bi "[what]"
bank7_4c52034e	bi	And if we wanted to "win" this game, at this point, it wasn't just enough to survive.	game/bank.rpy	2111	bi "[what]"
bank7_3d7460f5	bi	It's like those multiplayer team games, where you're trying to defend your-	game/bank.rpy	2112	bi "[what]"
bank7_f52953dd	s	Bert, you're not making another metaphor to video games in your head right now, are you?	game/bank.rpy	2113	s "[what]"
bank7_5854db22	b	...No.	game/bank.rpy	2114	b "[what]"
bank7_7514bc4f	bi	...Where was I?	game/bank.rpy	2115	bi "[what]"
bank7_d2e1bf78	bi	Oh right.	game/bank.rpy	2116	bi "[what]"
bank7_45d6db52	bi	We had to push to find out who the Game Master was as soon as possible.	game/bank.rpy	2117	bi "[what]"
bank7_76f26e88	bi	We played too much defense, we had to go on the offense.	game/bank.rpy	2118	bi "[what]"
bank7_03b33d1e	bi	So we needed info from Sid.	game/bank.rpy	2119	bi "[what]"
bank7_0036ff51	bi	And he was more likely to talk if we played along with him.	game/bank.rpy	2120	bi "[what]"
bank7_6f3d4875	i	...	game/bank.rpy	2121	i "[what]"
bank7_46a34837	i	I don't trust adults...	game/bank.rpy	2122	i "[what]"
bank7_2618479f	i	You're lying to me Bert, aren't you!	game/bank.rpy	2125	i "[what]"
bank7_307aebd0	i	You want all the money for yourself and you're trying to distract me!	game/bank.rpy	2126	i "[what]"
bank7_480f4d95	s	Ah, back to pea-brain mode I see.	game/bank.rpy	2127	s "[what]"
bank7_bc723391	i	Grrrrrr.	game/bank.rpy	2128	i "[what]"
bank7_5fa30902	bi	I... think that means Sid has moved on?	game/bank.rpy	2129	bi "[what]"
bank7_c4c94032	b	Sid we just want some more information about that lawsuit.	game/bank.rpy	2130	b "[what]"
bank7_b9f6eb95	b	I feel like we're at a point where any one little thing could reveal the Game Master...	game/bank.rpy	2131	b "[what]"
bank7_5c82e516	s	Really?	game/bank.rpy	2132	s "[what]"
bank7_2c69106e	s	I thought you-	game/bank.rpy	2133	s "[what]"
bank7_c11577ab	bi	I flashed Sam a look.	game/bank.rpy	2134	bi "[what]"
bank7_5671faa3	s	Oh, yeah, I guess we are pretty close.	game/bank.rpy	2135	s "[what]"
bank7_44f4e660	i	Oh.	game/bank.rpy	2136	i "[what]"
bank7_d734c464	i	So you're saying like... if I knew anything important than I'd save everyone's lives.	game/bank.rpy	2139	i "[what]"
bank7_676aff42	b	Uh...	game/bank.rpy	2140	b "[what]"
bank7_33120605	b	I guess so, yeah?	game/bank.rpy	2141	b "[what]"
bank7_7a813a46	i	And like, you'd all probably give me money for being the hero afterwards.	game/bank.rpy	2142	i "[what]"
bank7_850ef128_4	b	...	game/bank.rpy	2143	b "[what]"
bank7_519ce5d7	s	We can discuss helping you out later after we get out of here.	game/bank.rpy	2144	s "[what]"
bank7_7d82420e	i	I'm not hearing a "yes."	game/bank.rpy	2145	i "[what]"
bank7_432795e1	b	But you're also not hearing a "no."	game/bank.rpy	2146	b "[what]"
bank7_6989feb8	bi	I gave him a fat grin.	game/bank.rpy	2147	bi "[what]"
bank7_0d14b7c1	i	That's not good enough.	game/bank.rpy	2148	i "[what]"
bank7_86c2581e	b	What if... I see if I can get you a part-time job at my company.	game/bank.rpy	2149	b "[what]"
bank7_e3860e48	b	If you're actually this good a hacker we could definitely find a place for you.	game/bank.rpy	2150	b "[what]"
bank7_293091d7	i	Hm... okay, we'll negotiate later.	game/bank.rpy	2151	i "[what]"
bank7_75decc8d	i	So, about the lawsuit...	game/bank.rpy	2152	i "[what]"
bank7_fea7c460	i	I mean, it's still kind of a sore spot for me...	game/bank.rpy	2153	i "[what]"
bank7_e1c9ef22	i	But only in relation to family. So as long as you're not asking about them I'll talk.	game/bank.rpy	2154	i "[what]"
bank7_5b322a45	i	What do you want to know?	game/bank.rpy	2155	i "[what]"
bank7_19460ba9	b	Well, there's just one big thing...	game/bank.rpy	2156	b "[what]"
bank7_e0aa4207	b	When did you plant the file the lawyers asked you to plant?	game/bank.rpy	2157	b "[what]"
bank7_029c939f	i	It was... when I was eleven, I think? So about five years ago.	game/bank.rpy	2158	i "[what]"
bank7_0fce14f9	bi	Eleven? The kid's seriously a computer genius...	game/bank.rpy	2159	bi "[what]"
bank7_405b2a16	bi	I didn't mean it earlier, but maybe I should actually hire him after this game...	game/bank.rpy	2160	bi "[what]"
bank7_9a72624d	b	So you weren't lying in the hospital when we asked who had committed crimes in the last three years.	game/bank.rpy	2161	b "[what]"
bank7_12c0f2bc	i	Yeah, I wasn't.	game/bank.rpy	2162	i "[what]"
bank7_108d2c6a	i	...Wait, did you think I was?	game/bank.rpy	2163	i "[what]"
bank7_35ba70ca_1	b	What?	game/bank.rpy	2164	b "[what]"
bank7_027ee403	b	Oh no no no that isn't.	game/bank.rpy	2165	b "[what]"
bank7_0da79128	i	I knew it! You were trying to pin me as the mastermind and get me killed!	game/bank.rpy	2166	i "[what]"
bank7_e2967e24	i	Then you could take the money without me!	game/bank.rpy	2167	i "[what]"
bank7_2d8298ad	s	Sid, I know you don't think I have any authority, but none of that is true and you know it.	game/bank.rpy	2168	s "[what]"
bank7_5071ef3e	s	We're trying to figure it out.	game/bank.rpy	2169	s "[what]"
bank7_ecf51833	i	Grrrrr.	game/bank.rpy	2170	i "[what]"
bank7_eae90d64	s	Anyway Sydell lost contact with me three years ago...	game/bank.rpy	2171	s "[what]"
bank7_cdb0a1b0	s	That's also roughly when Shahar was lobotomized.	game/bank.rpy	2172	s "[what]"
bank7_e727bf1a	s	So if the lawsuit happened four years ago...	game/bank.rpy	2173	s "[what]"
bank7_26c52841	s	Did Sydell's personality change was because of something different?	game/bank.rpy	2174	s "[what]"
bank7_436b2a72	s	And I guess, him disappearing from my life was also because of something different?	game/bank.rpy	2175	s "[what]"
bank7_0e6d9ac6	i	Wait, what made you say the lawsuit happened five years ago?	game/bank.rpy	2178	i "[what]"
bank7_fdc776b3	s	...Because that's when you planted the email?	game/bank.rpy	2179	s "[what]"
bank7_bcceb95e	i	Well yeah, but the lawsuit took years to go to court.	game/bank.rpy	2180	i "[what]"
bank7_78ac3f9e	b	{i}Years?{/i}	game/bank.rpy	2181	b "[what]"
bank7_d26a6b8c	i	Yeah. At least, I think it did.	game/bank.rpy	2182	i "[what]"
bank7_54542f3a	i	I only got an email from that lawyer saying I had done my part two years later.	game/bank.rpy	2183	i "[what]"
bank7_1a74f8fd	s	"Done your part?"	game/bank.rpy	2184	s "[what]"
bank7_d7cd296c	i	Yeah, like, they won the lawsuit with my help.	game/bank.rpy	2185	i "[what]"
bank7_667afaa3	b	So it was three years ago...	game/bank.rpy	2186	b "[what]"
bank7_d83f0795	i	Yeah, unless they emailed me really late.	game/bank.rpy	2187	i "[what]"
bank7_e3e0bec5	i	So, did I do it?	game/bank.rpy	2188	i "[what]"
bank7_e5b83d74	i	Did I solve the mystery?	game/bank.rpy	2189	i "[what]"
bank7_c87fdf87	s	Not quite...	game/bank.rpy	2190	s "[what]"
bank7_5e0ff2d7	s	The lawsuit being three years ago means it's probably at least part of why Sydell disappeared.	game/bank.rpy	2191	s "[what]"
bank7_8153dda5	s	But Dracula already told us that he thought the lawsuit was the reason for this game.	game/bank.rpy	2192	s "[what]"
bank7_073c4b42	s	So we already knew it was deeply important...	game/bank.rpy	2193	s "[what]"
bank7_f6814cae	b	I wonder if he disappeared to start planning this game then...	game/bank.rpy	2194	b "[what]"
bank7_9bd4340c	b	Perhaps he found out Shahar, Dracula, Stella, and Sid were partially responsible.	game/bank.rpy	2195	b "[what]"
bank7_9f447b2c	b	Then brought in people who tangentially hurt him, like Sam and Catherine, to round it out.	game/bank.rpy	2196	b "[what]"
bank7_1fa51586	s	But why would he need to disappear to do that?	game/bank.rpy	2197	s "[what]"
bank7_07487311	b	Maybe... he wanted to distance himself from everyone before trapping them?	game/bank.rpy	2198	b "[what]"
bank7_381e3502	i	I mean, isn't there an easier explanation for why he disappeared?	game/bank.rpy	2199	i "[what]"
bank7_bf3dafc0	i	What if he died?	game/bank.rpy	2200	i "[what]"
bank7_e94ac96f	b	Died?	game/bank.rpy	2201	b "[what]"
bank7_f4e081e3	s	...Huh, I guess that would make sense, yeah.	game/bank.rpy	2202	s "[what]"
bank7_87256c2e	s	I always wondered if he moved on to a new dealer or he just quit cold turkey.	game/bank.rpy	2203	s "[what]"
bank7_8c13d88c	s	But if he died that explains why he, well, no longer needed my services.	game/bank.rpy	2204	s "[what]"
bank7_a8e4fb2f	b	Who's running the game if he died, then?	game/bank.rpy	2205	b "[what]"
bank7_9d3de6a8	i	I dunno, but if I figured something out then you owe me.	game/bank.rpy	2206	i "[what]"
bank7_1685091f	i	My consulting fee is $100,000!	game/bank.rpy	2207	i "[what]"
bank7_59ceb764	b	That's more than I have in my bank account...	game/bank.rpy	2208	b "[what]"

bank7_55877cf6	i	Okay, okay, maybe I was highballing you a bit.	game/bank.rpy	2210	i "[what]"
bank7_2701e30a	i	We can call it a cool $50,000 instead.	game/bank.rpy	2211	i "[what]"
bank7_308ef869	s	For $50,000 you have to at least name who the Game Master is.	game/bank.rpy	2212	s "[what]"

bank7_adba3bbd	b	Yeah, we don't know who's running the game...	game/bank.rpy	2217	b "[what]"
bank7_9a9c0a63	b	But if it isn't Sydell, all the connections can't be a lawsuit, right?	game/bank.rpy	2218	b "[what]"
bank7_cd5c7d42	b	It has to be someone closely related to him...	game/bank.rpy	2219	b "[what]"
bank7_ce3e2a83	i	Maybe someone getting revenge for him after his death.	game/bank.rpy	2220	i "[what]"
bank7_94145f18	s	Regardless, this is all just speculation...	game/bank.rpy	2221	s "[what]"
bank7_58dc1f66	s	He could very well be alive and just sitting in a room somewhere laughing at us...	game/bank.rpy	2222	s "[what]"
bank7_e38a7958	b	Well if that's the case we're screwed regardless.	game/bank.rpy	2223	b "[what]"
bank7_ce84ffab	b	Unless there's an alternate win condition we don't know of.	game/bank.rpy	2224	b "[what]"
bank7_34e18b7e	s	Seems unlikely.	game/bank.rpy	2225	s "[what]"
bank7_99f8c71e	b	Right. So I'd rather assume someone here is indeed Game Master and we have a shot.	game/bank.rpy	2226	b "[what]"
bank7_452d9e32	bi	I need to think... I feel like there's some argument for who it is that's missing...	game/bank.rpy	2227	bi "[what]"

bank7_7d1e5449	l	Oh no... it happened again.	game/bank.rpy	2457	l "[what]"
bank7_06aeced6	l	Freddy hasn't seen this, right?	game/bank.rpy	2458	l "[what]"
bank7_d054a9f1	b	No, he was with me in the lounge before I ran here.	game/bank.rpy	2459	b "[what]"
bank7_7bc46319	bi	I briefed Lauren on what happened.	game/bank.rpy	2460	bi "[what]"
bank7_e5bbc0ff	l	Bert... that was noble, but dumb of you.	game/bank.rpy	2461	l "[what]"
bank7_87703efd	b	Yeah, I know...	game/bank.rpy	2462	b "[what]"
bank7_3ac4ab3c	j	If there's a silver lining... at least this murder is easy to figure out.	game/bank.rpy	2463	j "[what]"
bank7_ffd7ffac	b	It is?	game/bank.rpy	2464	b "[what]"
bank7_399328d0	j	You saw Sam with the gun in the lobby...	game/bank.rpy	2465	j "[what]"
bank7_5c9126b9	j	Next, we find Sam in here with a bullet precisely in the temple...	game/bank.rpy	2466	j "[what]"
bank7_3634f7de	l	Yeah, it's a suicide.	game/bank.rpy	2467	l "[what]"
bank7_662e8130	b	Are we sure no one overpowered Sam and stole the gun?	game/bank.rpy	2468	b "[what]"
bank7_655192c1	l	Bert, you might be the type to try to fight someone with a gun.	game/bank.rpy	2469	l "[what]"
bank7_7b8f0867	l	But let's be real, if the gun was loaded and someone fought Sam...	game/bank.rpy	2470	l "[what]"
bank7_cd5c5e7d	bi	Yeah... Sam would just shoot them.	game/bank.rpy	2471	bi "[what]"
bank7_276762db	bi	I tried to think of another way things could have played out...	game/bank.rpy	2472	bi "[what]"
bank7_2107841c	bi	I wanted to believe Sam was stronger than that, but...	game/bank.rpy	2473	bi "[what]"
bank7_8f463f73	bi	It made too much sense.	game/bank.rpy	2474	bi "[what]"
bank7_7ccbd8e1	bi	At the same time, I couldn't accept it.	game/bank.rpy	2475	bi "[what]"
bank7_727b7864	b	But... why?	game/bank.rpy	2476	b "[what]"
bank7_dc8ac284	b	Why would Sam try to kill me and Freddy and then...	game/bank.rpy	2477	b "[what]"
bank7_55efc4c3	l	Sam was pretty torn up about trying to kill Stella.	game/bank.rpy	2478	l "[what]"
bank7_5a7a880c	b	But... Sam was recovering from a funk...	game/bank.rpy	2479	b "[what]"
bank7_9e435029	l	I don't know, maybe trying to kill you and Freddy broke Sam again.	game/bank.rpy	2480	l "[what]"
bank7_3c77317a	j	It could also be a nobility thing.	game/bank.rpy	2481	j "[what]"
bank7_96b6b21a	j	This way, only Sam has to die, and it kind of spares the rest of us?	game/bank.rpy	2482	j "[what]"
bank7_850ef128_5	b	...	game/bank.rpy	2483	b "[what]"
bank7_d515c286	bi	I was out of words.	game/bank.rpy	2484	bi "[what]"
bank7_9af8ea51	j	So... should we get Sid and Freddy and make sure we all agree?	game/bank.rpy	2485	j "[what]"
bank7_af7a3412	l	I don't exactly want to bring Freddy here, maybe we can meet in the lounge?	game/bank.rpy	2486	l "[what]"
bank7_034eb52a	j	Works for me, okay with you Bert?	game/bank.rpy	2487	j "[what]"
bank7_8d3a123d	bi	Is it really that easy?	game/bank.rpy	2488	bi "[what]"
bank7_808b5bae	bi	Are they just too tired of this game to push for the truth?	game/bank.rpy	2489	bi "[what]"
bank7_fe015204	bi	Part of me wants to be like that.	game/bank.rpy	2490	bi "[what]"
bank7_18cb41b3	bi	It wants nothing more than to just lay down and accept my fate.	game/bank.rpy	2491	bi "[what]"
bank7_4a5c54c7	bi	But another part...	game/bank.rpy	2492	bi "[what]"
bank7_4974445e	bi	Even if we're 99% confident it was a suicide, for that part it isn't enough.	game/bank.rpy	2493	bi "[what]"
bank7_acdb9593	b	No, I think we should investigate.	game/bank.rpy	2494	b "[what]"
bank7_7623f8d1	b	Remember when we were sure Sam killed Stella?	game/bank.rpy	2495	b "[what]"
bank7_ef63b7c9	b	If we accepted the most obvious possibility as the truth, we'd be dead.	game/bank.rpy	2496	b "[what]"
bank7_0f7e3587	l	...Yeah, you're right.	game/bank.rpy	2497	l "[what]"
bank7_520a0231	l	If only to honor Sam's life, we should be sure.	game/bank.rpy	2498	l "[what]"
bank7_777f05dc	j	Well, guess it's time to investigate!	game/bank.rpy	2499	j "[what]"
bank7_7e57fc4f	j	Murder solving squad let's go!	game/bank.rpy	2500	j "[what]"
hospPreInv2_eff25545	l	Oh, but I'm going to go the lobby and make sure Freddy's okay...	game/bank.rpy	2507	l "[what]"
hospPreInv2_a745b9e7	l	Hearing gunshots must have been super traumatic for him.	game/bank.rpy	2508	l "[what]"
hospPreInv2_ff746b9b	b	Yeah, go ahead.	game/bank.rpy	2509	b "[what]"
hospPreInv2_c33b9aee	b	We'll get started here.	game/bank.rpy	2510	b "[what]"
hospPreInv2_54d89ead	l	Good luck, guys. Let me know if you find anything.	game/bank.rpy	2511	l "[what]"
hospPreInv2_494d0667	b	Jenny, can you do me a favor?	game/bank.rpy	2516	b "[what]"
hospPreInv2_9fbca821	j	Huh?	game/bank.rpy	2517	j "[what]"
hospPreInv2_e1e72a62	b	Can you go with Lauren? We should make sure no one is alone for too long...	game/bank.rpy	2518	b "[what]"
hospPreInv2_7bc94b1b	j	Oh. Sure! I'm not the best at this anyway...	game/bank.rpy	2519	j "[what]"
hospPreInv2_ac2f74b9	bi	...	game/bank.rpy	2521	bi "[what]"
hospPreInv2_8adc8605	bi	...There's five of us left.	game/bank.rpy	2522	bi "[what]"
hospPreInv2_0f0afa1b	bi	I know I'm innocent, and I doubt Freddy is the Game Master.	game/bank.rpy	2523	bi "[what]"
hospPreInv2_57900593	bi	So Jenny, Lauren, Sid.	game/bank.rpy	2524	bi "[what]"
hospPreInv2_044b1cba	bi	I probably can't trust any of them.	game/bank.rpy	2525	bi "[what]"
hospPreInv2_af12709b	bi	At some point, I should ask them what they were up to prior to discovering the body.	game/bank.rpy	2526	bi "[what]"
hospPreInv2_0eb65da4	bi	I should start by committing to memory what I can about the series of events that just happened...	game/bank.rpy	2527	bi "[what]"
hospPreInv2_d4128793	blank	Bert's Account was added to evidence.	game/bank.rpy	2532	blank "[what]"
hospPreInv2_2ae78439	bi	Next, I should search this room thoroughly...	game/bank.rpy	2533	bi "[what]"
trial4a_86d36ec2	bi	I returned to the lobby where everyone was already gathered.	game/bank.rpy	2537	bi "[what]"
trial4a_f6d52b1b	bi	They all stayed here for the entire investigation, so I caught them up to speed on everything I found.	game/bank.rpy	2542	bi "[what]"
trial4a_6a91e2bc	bi	Which wasn't much, unfortunately.	game/bank.rpy	2543	bi "[what]"
trial4a_eb33f2a5	j	Not going to lie...	game/bank.rpy	2548	j "[what]"
trial4a_eb261585	j	It seems like Sam committed suicide here.	game/bank.rpy	2549	j "[what]"
trial4a_70bb7b9d	l	You're that confident already?	game/bank.rpy	2550	l "[what]"
trial4a_c1020dfb	l	We haven't even discussed anything yet.	game/bank.rpy	2551	l "[what]"
trial4a_ee17b250	l	Usually we need to do a whole song and dance just to come to a consensus.	game/bank.rpy	2552	l "[what]"
trial4a_4c35495b	j	Well, it's different this time.	game/bank.rpy	2553	j "[what]"
trial4a_66f0a5ab	j	When Dan, Stella, and Shahar died...	game/bank.rpy	2554	j "[what]"
trial4a_337d7896	j	All three of them were killed remotely.	game/bank.rpy	2555	j "[what]"
trial4a_704736d7	j	So we didn't see the killer in action at all.	game/bank.rpy	2556	j "[what]"
trial4a_f5c1fefb	j	But this time, Bert saw Sam in the guard uniform.	game/bank.rpy	2557	j "[what]"
trial4a_bf11c107	j	The same one Sam's wearing now.	game/bank.rpy	2558	j "[what]"
trial4a_a32b4205	b	Well, I saw {i}someone{/i} in the guard uniform in here.	game/bank.rpy	2559	b "[what]"
trial4a_5aae0277	b	It wasn't necessarily Sam, right?	game/bank.rpy	2560	b "[what]"
trial4a_e4de41f7	j	No, I think the person who shot you and Freddy was Sam.	game/bank.rpy	2561	j "[what]"
trial4a_7b062958	j	Don't you see it in the evidence you found?	game/bank.rpy	2562	j "[what]"
trial4a_4cdab69e	bi	The evidence? Let's see, what makes it seem like they're the same person...	game/bank.rpy	2563	bi "[what]"
trial4b_8a53cc73	b	Are you talking about the uniforms?	game/bank.rpy	2575	b "[what]"
trial4b_61e9b356	j	Yeah, you said that there was only one uniform missing from the lockers.	game/bank.rpy	2576	j "[what]"
trial4b_69e74ef1	j	But if Sam and the person who shot at you in the lobby are different people...	game/bank.rpy	2577	j "[what]"
trial4b_a2bef2b8	j	Two uniforms would have been taken out, one for each of them.	game/bank.rpy	2578	j "[what]"
trial4b_b580f369	l	Couldn't the person who shot at Bert just have put the uniform on Sam after running?	game/bank.rpy	2579	l "[what]"
trial4b_6087e960	j	Well, Bert chased the shooter after they ran away.	game/bank.rpy	2580	j "[what]"
trial4b_a5f73241	j	It would have taken a long time to change Sam's clothes, enough time that Bert would have caught them.	game/bank.rpy	2581	j "[what]"
trial4b_28d3d9f9	l	Hm... yeah, I can't argue with that.	game/bank.rpy	2582	l "[what]"
trial4b_ac2f74b9	bi	...	game/bank.rpy	2583	bi "[what]"
trial4b_e7c069ae	bi	It's true that a lot of signs point to Sam committing suicide.	game/bank.rpy	2584	bi "[what]"
trial4b_2e40b156	bi	But it's like the black swan.	game/bank.rpy	2585	bi "[what]"
trial4b_95319a85	bi	It's easy if you believe all swans are white to point at white swans and claim you're correct.	game/bank.rpy	2586	bi "[what]"
trial4b_2384ce9c	bi	Similarly, it's easy to look at the circumstances and come to Jenny's conclusion.	game/bank.rpy	2587	bi "[what]"
trial4b_6a8dbb61	bi	But a single black swan is all that it takes to disprove that theory.	game/bank.rpy	2588	bi "[what]"
trial4b_95705ce5	bi	As hard as it may be to find...	game/bank.rpy	2589	bi "[what]"
trial4b_84be78b2	bi	That's the only way to be certain of the truth.	game/bank.rpy	2590	bi "[what]"
trial4b_447b4d43	b	I think the uniform part isn't so important.	game/bank.rpy	2591	b "[what]"
trial4b_c58bec87	b	There's lots of ways that could be explained...	game/bank.rpy	2592	b "[what]"
trial4b_bcc62487	b	Maybe there's another one hidden somewhere we didn't know about, who knows.	game/bank.rpy	2593	b "[what]"
trial4b_5c8549d5	b	But there's somethign else I want to focus on...	game/bank.rpy	2594	b "[what]"
trial4b_2c996080	b	If Sam committed suicide, how did it happen?	game/bank.rpy	2595	b "[what]"
trial4b_809c9ce8	j	How?	game/bank.rpy	2596	j "[what]"
trial4b_38fe764a	j	You mean... like, with the gun to the head?	game/bank.rpy	2597	j "[what]"
trial4b_2d524073	b	Well, that, but when and where?	game/bank.rpy	2598	b "[what]"
trial4b_7dca8e0a	j	Colonel Mustard in the Ballroom with the Revolver!	game/bank.rpy	2599	j "[what]"
trial4b_c80c4760	b	...What?	game/bank.rpy	2600	b "[what]"
trial4b_640dba76	j	I said in the break room, between the shooting in the lounge and when we found the body.	game/bank.rpy	2601	j "[what]"
trial4b_08056505	b	Oh. Yeah, almost.	game/bank.rpy	2602	b "[what]"
trial4b_6c59bd05	b	We can actually narrow it down a bit more.	game/bank.rpy	2603	b "[what]"
trial4c_8bc7026c	b	If Sam committed suicide, the narrowest time range we can be sure it happened is...	game/bank.rpy	2606	b "[what]" nointeract
trial4c_d2b345f9	bi	This is true, but we can be more specific...	game/bank.rpy	2608	bi "[what]"
trial4c_e1bfa42a	bi	If Sam committed suicide right after leaving, the corpse would be in the hallway.	game/bank.rpy	2609	bi "[what]"
trial4c_889cb7f9	bi	I think we can be more specific, Sam wasn't right next to the door.	game/bank.rpy	2612	bi "[what]"
trial4c_1ef01d12	bi	It would have taken some time to move to the position the body was in.	game/bank.rpy	2613	bi "[what]"
trial4c_5a771bd1	bi	Yes, that's it!	game/bank.rpy	2616	bi "[what]"
trial4c_6a48aec6	bi	That's a bit too specific, it could have been earlier.	game/bank.rpy	2618	bi "[what]"
trial4c_d4ee151a	b	If Sam committed suicide, Sam would have had to do it after the door closed.	game/bank.rpy	2620	b "[what]"
trial4c_be9e9fa7	b	Since, well, Sam had to open the door first to get into the break room.	game/bank.rpy	2621	b "[what]"
trial4c_5b479641	j	Bert, that's not very insightful...	game/bank.rpy	2622	j "[what]"
trial4c_ff4e47e9	b	No, but think about it.	game/bank.rpy	2623	b "[what]"
trial4c_8244fc63	b	I don't think it's possible the gun was fired after the door closed, because...	game/bank.rpy	2624	b "[what]"
trial4d_d268c923	b	I saw the door to the break room close.	game/bank.rpy	2636	b "[what]"
trial4d_e4090b84	b	If a shot was fired, I was in the hallway when it happened.	game/bank.rpy	2637	b "[what]"
trial4d_d2edbb9a	b	So I would have heard it.	game/bank.rpy	2638	b "[what]"
trial4d_60162cb5	j	But weren't you in the lobby for all the gunshots?	game/bank.rpy	2639	j "[what]"
trial4d_8d3ec18a	j	Your ears must have been ringing, maybe you just couldn't hear anything?	game/bank.rpy	2640	j "[what]"
trial4d_b96e32f3	b	No, my ears were ringing but I was still able to hear the door close.	game/bank.rpy	2641	b "[what]"
trial4d_88517480	b	That would have been way quieter than the gunshot.	game/bank.rpy	2642	b "[what]"
trial4d_cb43db29	j	Hm...	game/bank.rpy	2643	j "[what]"
trial4d_a621de56	j	Is it possible the break room is soundproofed?	game/bank.rpy	2644	j "[what]"
trial4d_cc32334a	b	Soundproofed?	game/bank.rpy	2645	b "[what]"
trial4d_66cc3a22	j	Yeah, like... what if you just didn't hear the gunshot because the wall blocked the sound?	game/bank.rpy	2646	j "[what]"
trial4d_a1e5f3c7	b	Is it even possible to soundproof a wall that well?	game/bank.rpy	2647	b "[what]"
trial4d_128201b9	l	I doubt it... when you go to a firing range, they make you wear those noise-blocking headphones.	game/bank.rpy	2648	l "[what]"
trial4d_d5761e23	l	Those only give you 25 decibels of reduction.	game/bank.rpy	2649	l "[what]"
trial4d_2653da28	l	A gunshot would still be about as loud as a car engine.	game/bank.rpy	2650	l "[what]"
trial4d_ba85b434	j	Hm... okay, so the room probably wasn't soundproofed.	game/bank.rpy	2651	j "[what]"
trial4d_9fb4d5e9	j	I'm stumped then... how could Sam have committed suicide without Bert hearing?	game/bank.rpy	2652	j "[what]"
trial4d_0d081e0c	b	Well, if someone-{p=0.5}{nw}	game/bank.rpy	2653	b "[what]"
trial4d_82a42a18	l	There could be another explanation for why Bert didn't hear the gunshot.	game/bank.rpy	2654	l "[what]"
trial4d_1043e735	b	Huh?	game/bank.rpy	2655	b "[what]"
trial4d_abc4b270	l	What if someone else shot Sam?	game/bank.rpy	2656	l "[what]"
trial4d_9f380521	j	Someone else?	game/bank.rpy	2657	j "[what]"
trial4d_7d4272f6	l	Yeah, I think someone could have shot Sam without the rest of us hearing.	game/bank.rpy	2658	l "[what]"
trial4d_8cd7abec	l	Specifically, in the window of time Bert was talking about earlier.	game/bank.rpy	2659	l "[what]"
trial4d_7c379e19	bi	Oh.	game/bank.rpy	2660	bi "[what]"
trial4d_f3934f9b	bi	The person she's talking about is...	game/bank.rpy	2661	bi "[what]"
trial4e_078de1c3	b	You... think I did it?	game/bank.rpy	2673	b "[what]"
trial4e_45e2ba95	l	Sorry Bert, I trust you a lot more than I trusted Kaiser and Dracula. And to a lesser extent, Catherine.	game/bank.rpy	2674	l "[what]"
trial4e_66451229	l	You've been trying so hard to save the rest of us.	game/bank.rpy	2675	l "[what]"
trial4e_c3361314	l	But... hear me out, it just... makes a lot of sense.	game/bank.rpy	2676	l "[what]"
trial4f_cb270ee8	bi	I wanted to be mad, to think Lauren was insane.	game/bank.rpy	2684	bi "[what]"
trial4f_61d14560	bi	To go through all the emotions that Sid went through in the train.	game/bank.rpy	2685	bi "[what]"
trial4f_a26c11ef	bi	But...	game/bank.rpy	2686	bi "[what]"
trial4f_a756cd7c	bi	I have to admit, it is pretty suspicious.	game/bank.rpy	2687	bi "[what]"
trial4f_d0d6d7e8	bi	I would have heard it if Sam shot themself, yet I claim I didn't...	game/bank.rpy	2688	bi "[what]"
trial4f_c88a4cf4	bi	It makes it seems like I'm the murderer and I wasn't consistent about my story.	game/bank.rpy	2689	bi "[what]"
trial4f_a9cc8479	bi	I can't get worked up about this...	game/bank.rpy	2690	bi "[what]"
trial4f_1546e144	bi	If I want to live, I need to approach this with a level head.	game/bank.rpy	2691	bi "[what]"
trial4f_ea85dc53	bi	As hard as that may be under the circumstances...	game/bank.rpy	2692	bi "[what]"
trial4f_62af634a	b	You say no one had seen Sam recently...	game/bank.rpy	2699	b "[what]"
trial4f_76a7c63a	b	But Freddy was there with me when my alibi happened.	game/bank.rpy	2700	b "[what]"
trial4f_e4f6e8f5	f	Did... did someone say my name?	game/bank.rpy	2707	f "[what]"
trial4f_64927c82	f	*sniff*	game/bank.rpy	2708	f "[what]"
trial4f_42cd60f9	bi	Poor kid... he's probably still in shock.	game/bank.rpy	2709	bi "[what]"
trial4f_3690887d	l	Bert... he's just a kid, don't use him as a tool.	game/bank.rpy	2710	l "[what]"
trial4f_f27fe627	b	I'm... I'm not using him.	game/bank.rpy	2711	b "[what]"
trial4f_62fc44ef	b	Freddy saw what unfolded in here.	game/bank.rpy	2712	b "[what]"
trial4f_0eb4ae18	f	What... unfolded?	game/bank.rpy	2713	f "[what]"
trial4f_addbcc2c	b	Freddy... you remember the loud noises? And when I fell to the floor in here?	game/bank.rpy	2714	b "[what]"
trial4f_a4812704	f	I... I don't wanna remember...	game/bank.rpy	2715	f "[what]"
trial4f_914efabf	f	Can't it be nap time now?	game/bank.rpy	2716	f "[what]"
trial4f_a07deb8b	b	Freddy, just for a few seconds, can you help us?	game/bank.rpy	2717	b "[what]"
trial4f_357b1cf1	b	When the loud noises happened who was in here with you?	game/bank.rpy	2718	b "[what]"
trial4f_ef96cbe5	f	Uh... you were there.	game/bank.rpy	2719	f "[what]"
trial4f_ff3bc721	b	Anyone else?	game/bank.rpy	2720	b "[what]"
trial4f_a6d5ab10	f	Yeah... someone dressed up for Halloween... but they were actually scary!	game/bank.rpy	2721	f "[what]"
trial4f_1c580139	f	I... I...	game/bank.rpy	2722	f "[what]"
trial4f_066c3e34	b	That's enough Freddy, thanks. You can take a nap now if you want.	game/bank.rpy	2723	b "[what]"
trial4f_c1ad3642	f	O-okay, I'll try...	game/bank.rpy	2724	f "[what]"
trial4f_51b179d2	i	So it seems like Bert was telling the truth after all.	game/bank.rpy	2729	i "[what]"
trial4f_782188f7	i	You and me, Bert, we're one and the same.	game/bank.rpy	2730	i "[what]"
trial4f_4c7804b6	bi	I wouldn't say that...	game/bank.rpy	2731	bi "[what]"
trial4f_0bf50374	i	Misunderstood, needlessly accused.	game/bank.rpy	2732	i "[what]"
trial4f_f54dab09	i	You're a bully, Lauren, just like every other adult!	game/bank.rpy	2735	i "[what]"
trial4f_65e88b04	bi	I have to say, Sid coming to my defense isn't exactly helping.	game/bank.rpy	2736	bi "[what]"
trial4f_aedc5e8e	l	Freddy seeing Bert leave doesn't mean that Bert didn't shoot Sam.	game/bank.rpy	2737	l "[what]"
trial4f_7ecd61bc	i	Huh?	game/bank.rpy	2740	i "[what]"
trial4f_2914dcd2	l	Sure, Freddy can confirm that Sam came to the lounge, took six shots, and ran.	game/bank.rpy	2741	l "[what]"
trial4f_ba73437c	l	And you're probably not lying about running out to chase Sam.	game/bank.rpy	2742	l "[what]"
trial4f_a20aa2bb	l	But what if this is what actually happened...	game/bank.rpy	2743	l "[what]"
trial4f_66dbbe04	l	Bert chased after Sam, in an act of heroism.	game/bank.rpy	2744	l "[what]"
trial4f_36415e13	l	Sam went into the break room, followed by Bert.	game/bank.rpy	2745	l "[what]"
trial4f_362c0ad2	l	Somehow Bert overpowered them, grabbing the gun and shooting Sam.	game/bank.rpy	2746	l "[what]"
trial4f_108443a4	i	Wait... if Bert is the murderer, why was Sam trying to shoot people?	game/bank.rpy	2747	i "[what]"
bankCorpse_6590a828	bi	Sam's corpse...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	234	bi "[what]"
bankCorpse_dc790230	bi	There's a bullet hole in the temple, consistent with an attempt at suicide.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	235	bi "[what]"
bankCorpse_c722854b	bi	But is that really what happened?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	236	bi "[what]"
bankCorpse_c9b1c57c	bi	Sam...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	239	bi "[what]"
bankCorpse_1312a3e9	bi	Just when you were recovering, just when we had made so much progress together.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	240	bi "[what]"
bankCorpse_218de753	bi	Did you really collapse in that moment?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	241	bi "[what]"
bankCorpse_c5feef92	bi	I have a hard time believing that.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	242	bi "[what]"
bankCorpse_2ae50a54	bi	Either something happened that made Sam's mind change in an instant...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	243	bi "[what]"
bankCorpse_a74771dd	bi	Or somebody else here is hiding something.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	244	bi "[what]"
bankCorpse_2731d6ba	bi	If I want to survive I need to approach this all as objectively as possible.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	245	bi "[what]"
bankCorpse_f30ff6d3	bi	And really, the rational thing is to hope it was a suicide.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	246	bi "[what]"
bankCorpse_766af11e	bi	Then no one else has to die.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	247	bi "[what]"
bankCorpse_20a2ea44	bi	But somehow...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	248	bi "[what]"
bankCorpse_bd460229	bi	I find myself wishing it wasn't.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	249	bi "[what]"
bankCorpse_198be8bd	bi	At least when the murders happened, it was someone trying to survive.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	250	bi "[what]"
bankCorpse_6e705711	bi	So if someone gave up like that, without even trying...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	251	bi "[what]"
bankCorpse_eadd60b7	bi	Even if one less person dies, in a weird way it's sadder.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	252	bi "[what]"
bankCorpse_ac2f74b9	bi	...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	253	bi "[what]"
bankCorpse_252c615b	bi	But again, emotions don't really matter right now.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	254	bi "[what]"
bankCorpse_f44c64dd	bi	Let me inspect this corpse in more detail.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	255	bi "[what]"
bankCorpse_d74c57e4	bi	The obvious detail is the bullet hole in the head...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	256	bi "[what]"
bankCorpse_f7cf9209	bi	...And besides that, I don't really see anything.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	257	bi "[what]"
bankCorpse_b4132db4	bi	It does look like what I'd imagine a suicide should look like...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	258	bi "[what]"
bankCorpse_ac2f74b9_1	bi	...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	259	bi "[what]"
bankCorpse_17008d89	bi	Yeah, I've looked over this body three or four times now.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	260	bi "[what]"
bankCorpse_20269dfb	bi	Maybe this is just a murder where the body doesn't have the answers.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	261	bi "[what]"

bankGun_0ce47b1d	bi	The gun that presumably Sam used to commit suicide.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	298	bi "[what]"
bankGun_4aad630f	bi	It holds six bullets at once, and is empty right now...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	299	bi "[what]"

bankGun_04709b02	bi	If only we had access to the stuff real detectives have.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	303	bi "[what]"

bankGun_53ee995b	bi	Anyway... I've never held a gun before.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	305	bi "[what]"
bankGun_595aa532	bi	I should make sure to point it away from me while I'm looking at it...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	306	bi "[what]"
bankGun_e4c3aae4	bi	Hm, how do I open the...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	307	bi "[what]"
bankGun_02ba5da8	bi	The chamber?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	308	bi "[what]"
bankGun_0da58fea	bi	Or is the tube the bullet fires from the chamber?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	309	bi "[what]"

bankGun_a643eaf6	blank	Click.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	311	blank "[what]"
bankGun_92d46aa3	bi	Oh. That button releases it.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	312	bi "[what]"
bankGun_1c1478c8	bi	Hm, the gun appears to hold six bullets.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	313	bi "[what]"
bankGun_c8ec3222	bi	It's currently empty. Probably still was a good idea to point it away...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	314	bi "[what]"
bankGun_7f1d60d1	bi	Where did this even come from? Was this here the whole time and none of us found it?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	315	bi "[what]"
bankGun_9dd00f75	bi	...Oh?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	316	bi "[what]"
bankGun_fbaf6532	bi	There's a burnt shell on the ground, near-ish Sam's head.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	317	bi "[what]"
bankGun_fdd1523e	bi	Let me see...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	318	bi "[what]"

bankSid_0d5a5af6	bi	But that would have been a while ago.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	491	bi "[what]"
bankSid_bc093a44	bi	Did I really finish searching the break room in the time Sid took to walk over here?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	492	bi "[what]"
bankSid_20441fe6	bi	Anyway, now I know the safe is open. I should probably investigate there at some point.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	493	bi "[what]"
bankSid_5529e759	bi	Besides that, I still need to interrogate Jenny and Lauren...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	494	bi "[what]"
bankSid_8fd486f2	bi	There's nothing in this hallway that seems interesting, so I should move on.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	495	bi "[what]"
bankShells_582f57d8	b	There are six bullet shells on the floor by the door to the hallway.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	557	b "[what]"
bankShells_ed925ee4	b	This is where the person in the uniform was standing, and they match the shell I found near Sam...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	558	b "[what]"
bankShells_5c89839a	b	So they probably were from when Freddy and I were shot at.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	559	b "[what]"
bankShells_c7886607	b	Are these...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	561	b "[what]"
bankShells_5404be05	j	Find something Bert?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	563	j "[what]"
bankShells_db6bab01	b	Yeah, these look like bullet shells...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	564	b "[what]"
bankShells_685b8507	j	Oh... well, you did say you were shot at, right?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	565	j "[what]"
bankShells_a4e88874	b	Yeah, and the person in the uniform was standing about here when they shot at us...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	566	b "[what]"
bankShells_56608b82	j	So this is probably the "leftovers" from that shooting.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	567	j "[what]"
bankShells_d241dac7	b	I guess so...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	568	b "[what]"
bankShells_27fef87d	bi	I picked one up and took a closer look.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	569	bi "[what]"
bankShells_f805e3e5	b	It looks like one that was near Sam's body.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	570	b "[what]"
bankShells_3a83922c	j	Hm... I mean, that makes sense if Sam was the one that shot at you.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	571	j "[what]"
bankShells_d4968122	j	Then the same gun and bullets would have been used for both shootings.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	572	j "[what]"
bankShells_a7c36428	b	That's one possibility, but I don't know if it's the only explanation.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	573	b "[what]"
bankShells_2553c3d0	j	What other explanations are there?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	574	j "[what]"
bankShells_8e24bf0a	b	I'm not sure yet...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	575	b "[what]"
bankShells_90e9cb52	j	Hm... okay, Jenny brainstorm time!	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	576	j "[what]"
bankShells_89dc055f	bi	Jenny went and sat down with a serious look on her face...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	578	bi "[what]"
bankShells_905c1f23	bi	It'd be nice if she solved the case for us, but I won't count on it.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	579	bi "[what]"
bankShells_52efdd63	bi	Anyway...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	580	bi "[what]"
bankShells_fa9679fd	bi	There are six shells on the floor here.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	581	bi "[what]"
bankShells_92cdedcb	bi	The gun I found near Sam could hold six bullets...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	582	bi "[what]"
bankShells_b1be3145	bi	Did the shooter run away because they had to reload?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	583	bi "[what]"
bankShells_4867530c	blank	Shells in the Lobby was added to evidence.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	588	blank "[what]"
bankShells_3204c0a7	bi	Okay, I've interrogated everyone.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	590	bi "[what]"
bankShells_f21e1523	bi	I was in this room before the uniformed person ran in here...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	591	bi "[what]"
bankShells_60391f1c	bi	So besides the shells, I don't think there's too much of importance here.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	592	bi "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_0caba24d	f	...*sniff*	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	602	f "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_770cc3bf	f	Bert... *sniff* when can I go home?...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	603	f "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_8c3a7932	b	We're trying our hardest Freddy.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	604	b "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_8de7250f	b	You can help us out by being real strong!	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	605	b "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_228e8e29	f	*sniff* Okay...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	606	f "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_774e574b	bi	Freddy's pretty shaken up...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	607	bi "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_51618be2	bi	I think it's best not to ask him to recall the shooting.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	608	bi "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_5954ea58	bi	You know... now that I think about it...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	611	bi "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_c804f555	bi	No one else besides Freddy saw the uniformed person.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	612	bi "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_4e9031c0	bi	So I should probably ask him what he remembers.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	613	bi "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_0ecf774d	b	Hey Freddy...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	614	b "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_f9225341	b	I know it wasn't very fun, but can you tell me what you remember about waking up in here earlier?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	615	b "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_70b54b9a	f	Oh...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	616	f "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_48655eac	f	Do I have to?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	617	f "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_05bfaa44	f	It was so scary... I just want to go back to sleep.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	618	f "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_9d038452	b	Freddy, it'll help us out a lot if you can.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	619	b "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_5dc22829	b	And if you help us... uh...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	620	b "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_75d9408d	bi	Let's see, what would I want if I was a kid...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	621	bi "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_9da16516	b	I'll buy you the biggest frog toy ever once we get home!	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	622	b "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_02de392b	f	B-biggest?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	624	f "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_36c2ef1c	f	But... I already have one that's six feet tall and fifty pounds.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	625	f "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_ac2f74b9	bi	...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	626	bi "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_9c77370a	bi	Maybe I shouldn't have said biggest.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	627	bi "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_e849da64	b	Well... I'll find an even bigger one!	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	628	b "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_953f4057	f	Even bigger?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	629	f "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_ce8022b7	f	No way...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	630	f "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_788eaa2f	f	Okay, so um...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	631	f "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_a2089218	f	I woke up and heard like, BANG BANG BANG.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	632	f "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_376576a2	f	And my ears really hurt...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	633	f "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_85750ae6	f	And... *sniff* I was scared.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	635	f "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_b8b5b954	bi	He's starting to tear up...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	636	bi "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_3b284f09	bi	I can feel Lauren glaring at me right now, but this could be important...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	637	bi "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_17f2f013	b	C'mon Freddy, what else? You're a strong kid!	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	638	b "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_d873b1ec	bi	Really? That's what I say? It's so generic...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	639	bi "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_23efeece	f	And... and you fell to the floor and I thought you were hurt...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	640	f "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_fb26e87d	f	Are you okay, Mr. Bert?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	641	f "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_10e3792f	b	Oh yeah, I was just trying to hide.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	642	b "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_2d44bc52	f	Oh... okay.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	643	f "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_adddd39f	f	And then *sniff* I saw the person who made the BANG BANG BANG.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	644	f "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_d2b95dc5	f	And then they ran away...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	645	f "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_31129f67	f	And then... you chased after them *sniff*.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	646	f "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_0b254786	f	And I was alone and I was scared...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	647	f "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_378fac8c	f	And...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	648	f "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_c0db6e0d	f	I started crying... *sniff*.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	649	f "[what]"

bankInvFreddy_c22840ca	l	Is that true Freddy?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	658	l "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_b77a12c9	f	Y-yeah...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	659	f "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_b387aae7	b	You've been a real help Freddy!	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	660	b "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_89fe86e9	b	I think I'm done with questioning him, Lauren...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	661	b "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_d58b8bd0	l	Good, poor kid's been through enough.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	662	l "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_c78088de	bi	Well, it's nothing I didn't know, but...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	666	bi "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_70bd41b8	bi	Knowing Freddy saw everything that went down in here might be useful later.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	667	bi "[what]"
bankInvFreddy_a59f3e3f	blank	Freddy's Account was added to evidence.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	672	blank "[what]"

bankInvLauren_56829db2	l	You're done investigating already?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	686	l "[what]"
bankInvLauren_1d42b4e5	b	Oh, no, not yet...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	687	b "[what]"
bankInvLauren_819b2db7	b	Just wanted to confirm what you told me earlier.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	688	b "[what]"
bankInvLauren_77519569	b	You were searching in the office, then you finished and went looking for people.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	689	b "[what]"
bankInvLauren_a5be23e1	b	You walked past the safe, which was still closed, and checked the locker room.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	690	b "[what]"
bankInvLauren_df4e84f5	b	Then you walked past the couch towards the lobby, and heard us talking.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	691	b "[what]"
bankInvLauren_60856c43	l	And that's when I found you guys and saw the body, yup.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	692	l "[what]"
bankInvLauren_8ba9a761	l	Your memory's good Bert... I guess that's why you're doing the investigation.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	693	l "[what]"
bankInvLauren_126b5344	bi	Well... that and no one else above the age of ten could be trusted.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	694	bi "[what]"
bankInvLauren_a19241b6	b	Hey Lauren.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	697	b "[what]"
bankInvLauren_2158ba63	l	Hey Bert.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	698	l "[what]"
bankInvLauren_5896b196	b	I wanted to ask you what you were up to since I last saw you.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	699	b "[what]"
bankInvLauren_f2311ff9	l	You mean... in the break room?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	700	l "[what]"
bankInvLauren_020904c9	b	No, before that...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	701	b "[what]"
bankInvLauren_31ed8fb5	b	When you left to go search, Jenny went to go take a shower.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	702	b "[what]"
bankInvLauren_4b65eb68	b	From then, until you ran into Jenny and I in the break room.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	703	b "[what]"
bankInvLauren_9e6599bd	l	Oh, right.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	704	l "[what]"
bankInvLauren_6c40d3d1	l	Well, I was searching in the director's office...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	705	l "[what]"
bankInvLauren_a707dc63	l	Just trying to find anything that could be helpful, really.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	706	l "[what]"
bankInvLauren_69df0772	bi	I guess Lauren doesn't know how extensively Sam searched that room.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	707	bi "[what]"
bankInvLauren_7706f20f	bi	I won't belittle her efforts by telling her.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	708	bi "[what]"
bankInvLauren_7bcd8389	l	After some time I gave up and decided to look for people.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	709	l "[what]"
bankInvLauren_d5914d2b	l	So I went to the locker room since I knew Jenny might be in there.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	710	l "[what]"
bankInvLauren_8a593341	b	Was the safe open when you walked by?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	711	b "[what]"
bankInvLauren_c5903ddd	l	No, it wasn't open.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	712	l "[what]"
bankInvLauren_eddbd14e	b	Hm... okay.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	713	b "[what]"
bankInvLauren_6070e6d7	l	Anyway, I didn't find anyone in the locker room.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	714	l "[what]"
bankInvLauren_4f44168e	l	I also knew Sid liked napping on the couch in the hall, so I checked it out.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	715	l "[what]"
bankInvLauren_855e7e86	l	But he wasn't there.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	716	l "[what]"
bankInvLauren_6810e51e	l	So I figured everyone had gathered on this side of the building.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	717	l "[what]"
bankInvLauren_7a380781	l	I made my way over here, then heard you and Jenny talking in the break room.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	718	l "[what]"
bankInvLauren_672ada74	l	And well, you know what happened from there.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	719	l "[what]"
bankInvLauren_cc8094bd	b	Hm, okay. Let me recap to make sure I got this right.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	720	b "[what]"
bankInvLauren_2f1ab026	l	You were in the office, walked to the locker room, didn't find anyone, then came here.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	721	l "[what]"
bankInvLauren_1ee9882c	b	The safe was closed when you passed, and Sid wasn't on the couch when you looked.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	722	b "[what]"
bankInvLauren_34e991f2	l	Yup, that's right.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	723	l "[what]"
bankInvLauren_65f71fd6	blank	Lauren's Account was added to evidence.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	728	blank "[what]"

bankInvLauren_b4e2c3d9	l	No problem. I'm going to go back to making sure Freddy's ok...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	730	l "[what]"
bankInvLauren_ede71e16	bi	Hm... something strikes me as odd about what Lauren told me, but I can't quite tell what...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	732	bi "[what]"
bankInvLauren_3204c0a7	bi	Okay, I've interrogated everyone.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	734	bi "[what]"

bankInvJenny_f3e83f19	j	Heya Bert!	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	746	j "[what]"
bankInvJenny_e2e8a19b	j	I mean, uh, sheriff!	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	747	j "[what]"
bankInvJenny_99a2fb16	b	Hey Jenny, just want to make sure I remember your story correctly.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	748	b "[what]"
bankInvJenny_83678a40	b	You left the locker room, saw the safe was open, were going to wake up Sid...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	749	b "[what]"
bankInvJenny_277a47dc	b	Then you heard me yell and came to the break room.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	750	b "[what]"
bankInvJenny_79fd98fe	j	Yessir!	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	751	j "[what]"
bankInvJenny_ecca8d10	bi	I don't know if I'll get much more out of her while she's in "deputy mode"...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	752	bi "[what]"

bankInvJenny_6a35108c	j	Teehee, I was thinking, well, you're kind of like our sheriff.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	758	j "[what]"
bankInvJenny_5351dade	j	So I was thinking like... well, I'm your deputy.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	759	j "[what]"
bankInvJenny_44120e4e	j	And that means I should be speaking to you like a deputy would!	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	760	j "[what]"
bankInvJenny_b59f3432	b	I... I'm flattered, I think?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	761	b "[what]"
bankInvJenny_fbc4f373	b	Anyway, I wanted to ask what you were up to before we met in the break room.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	762	b "[what]"
bankInvJenny_c50811f3	j	Starting from when?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	763	j "[what]"

bankInvJenny_57f1ec7a	j	Bert! You want to know what I was doing in the locker room?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	766	j "[what]"
bankInvJenny_850ef128	b	...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	767	b "[what]"
bankInvJenny_92f8d14b	j	Just pulling your leg!	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	769	j "[what]"
bankInvJenny_1d5e3387	j	Hmm okay, I finished taking a shower.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	770	j "[what]"
bankInvJenny_fadf4d1b	j	I walked out of the locker room into the hall and I saw the lights had turned green.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	771	j "[what]"
bankInvJenny_f48b7af5	j	And that the safe door was open!	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	772	j "[what]"
bankInvJenny_09aeb27d	j	I also saw Sid taking a nap on the couch.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	773	j "[what]"
bankInvJenny_e31471ed	j	I thought maybe I'd wake him and we could check it out together.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	774	j "[what]"
bankInvJenny_25cd5492	j	You know, safety in numbers.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	775	j "[what]"
bankInvJenny_8b403d49	j	And also he might yell at me if I didn't tell him...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	776	j "[what]"
bankInvJenny_2751302a	j	But then I heard you yelling.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	777	j "[what]"
bankInvJenny_b918f380	j	I figured something must have happened...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	778	j "[what]"
bankInvJenny_6d4efd78	j	So I left Sid to enjoy his nap while the adults handled everything!	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	779	j "[what]"
bankInvJenny_22685217	bi	Jenny calling herself an adult and implying Sid isn't is an...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	780	bi "[what]"
bankInvJenny_ecf2d3d6	bi	Interesting statement to make.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	781	bi "[what]"
bankInvJenny_467c2f34	j	And uh, yeah, that's when I ran into you.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	783	j "[what]"
bankInvJenny_d8edf2a4	j	Oh, and I figured out who the Game Master is.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	784	j "[what]"
bankInvJenny_35ba70ca	b	What?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	785	b "[what]"
bankInvJenny_aec856bc	j	Kidding! Just making sure you're paying attention.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	786	j "[what]"
bankInvJenny_a9ca9f9a	b	Oh...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	787	b "[what]"
bankInvJenny_8890c6e1	bi	Not going to lie, part of me believed her...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	788	bi "[what]"
bankInvJenny_97c2c7ec	bi	Maybe a good thing. It means I still have hope.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	789	bi "[what]"
bankInvJenny_613a2294	b	Okay, so to summarize...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	790	b "[what]"
bankInvJenny_83678a40_1	b	You left the locker room, saw the safe was open, were going to wake up Sid...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	791	b "[what]"
bankInvJenny_277a47dc_1	b	Then you heard me yell and came to the break room.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	792	b "[what]"
bankInvJenny_ff10fc7f	j	Yep!	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	793	j "[what]"
bankInvJenny_3f21f191	blank	Jenny's Account was added to evidence.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	798	blank "[what]"
bankInvJenny_7bfa0f69	b	Alright, thanks Jenny.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	799	b "[what]"
bankInvJenny_c52e3d36	j	Yes sir sheriff sir!	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	800	j "[what]"
bankInvJenny_389f6b1d	b	...I don't know if deputies talk like they're in the military.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	801	b "[what]"
bankInvJenny_6a7ff3e7	j	Oh... that's a good point.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	802	j "[what]"
bankInvJenny_0da3c70e	bi	It's convenient that Jenny claims Sid was asleep when she passed him...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	804	bi "[what]"
bankInvJenny_2ca1256d	bi	Is she trying to make an alibi for herself using a sleeping witness?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	805	bi "[what]"
bankInvJenny_3204c0a7	bi	Okay, I've interrogated everyone.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	807	bi "[what]"
bankInvJenny_f21e1523	bi	I was in this room before the uniformed person ran in here...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	808	bi "[what]"
bankInvJenny_60391f1c	bi	So besides the shells, I don't think there's too much of importance here.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	809	bi "[what]"
bankSid2_c9f0621a	b	Hey Sid.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	818	b "[what]"
bankSid2_00427ede	i	Hey Bert.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	819	i "[what]"
bankSid2_d7ff1501	i	You here to bring me my money?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	820	i "[what]"
bankSid2_33605cde	b	Uh... not quite.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	821	b "[what]"
bankSid2_80f8ad7e	b	Just wanted to make sure I remembered what you told me earlier.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	822	b "[what]"
bankSid2_10ff14d7	i	You don't suspect me, do you?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	823	i "[what]"
bankSid2_1efad84e	bi	Maybe if I just don't acknowledge the question he won't get mad.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	824	bi "[what]"
bankSid2_d7b4ed06	b	So you woke up, saw the light was green, and went to check the safe door was open.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	825	b "[what]"
bankSid2_35072b2a	b	Then you heard someone scream, and you came to the break room and ran into me.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	826	b "[what]"
bankSid2_9549c002	i	Yeah, that's right.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	827	i "[what]"
bankSid2_c1bbebf8	b	Great, thanks Sid, you're being really helpful!	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	828	b "[what]"
bankSid2_82038581	i	Yeah, yeah, just don't forget about the money you owe me.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	829	i "[what]"
bankSid2_ff93e311	bi	The money I owe {i}if{/i} we find any in the safe...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	830	bi "[what]"
bankCouch_93edcd78	bi	That's the couch Sid was sleeping on.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	873	bi "[what]"
bankCouch_04368f41	bi	Maybe it's the fact that I only slept for a little bit and then had to investigate...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	874	bi "[what]"
bankCouch_beb26d50	bi	But it does look really comfortable to sleep on.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	875	bi "[what]"
bankCouch_7fcf37fa	bi	Surely I have time for a nap, right?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	876	bi "[what]"
bankCouch_ac2f74b9	bi	...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	877	bi "[what]"
bankCouch_4a2c4ddb	bi	No, I need to keep moving.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	878	bi "[what]"
bankCouch_15f5b06f	bi	Plus, it'd be less than ideal if the others caught me napping on the job.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	879	bi "[what]"
bankLights_e014fd3b	bi	The lights on the wall...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	887	bi "[what]"
bankLights_e48347af	bi	They were red before I tried to sleep.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	888	bi "[what]"
bankLights_9c52268d	bi	Now they're green.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	889	bi "[what]"
bankLights_1f445205	bi	The safe is also open, so presumably that's why...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	890	bi "[what]"
bankLights_18709056	bi	But I guess there's no way to know for sure.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	891	bi "[what]"
bankLights_38224328	bi	Well, we could re-lock the safe.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	892	bi "[what]"
bankLights_af1a5283	bi	But there might be crucial evidence in there...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	893	bi "[what]"
bankLights_cb3d57fc	bi	For now, I'll assume the lights indicate the safe is open.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	894	bi "[what]"
bankShelves_b48423b3	bi	It's a nice set of shelves for displaying objects.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	953	bi "[what]"
bankShelves_62b2ff6c	bi	But unless the bank director's photo of a random skyscraper is crucial to this case...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	954	bi "[what]"
bankShelves_94f9e546	bi	I don't think there's anything important here.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	955	bi "[what]"
bankDesk_da64d413	bi	Sam spent a lot of time searching in this room, including the desk.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	963	bi "[what]"
bankDesk_b94b56f8	bi	So it's probably not worth looking at every single file again.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	964	bi "[what]"
bankDesk_8f235231	bi	But I should at least make sure there's nothing hidden here...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	965	bi "[what]"
bankDesk_ac2f74b9	bi	...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	966	bi "[what]"
bankDesk_0b4ccbc8	bi	I took a look in each of the drawers, but I didn't see anything noticeable.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	967	bi "[what]"
bankCabinet_aa92f3fd	bi	There's a good chance we didn't find every piece of info in these filing cabinets...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	975	bi "[what]"
bankCabinet_bc860125	bi	And there's also a good chance if I spent a week looking through them I still would miss something.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	976	bi "[what]"
bankCabinet_4442ea3c	bi	Who even needs a filing cabinet this big when Koogle Drive exists?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	977	bi "[what]"
bankCabinet_52efdd63	bi	Anyway...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	978	bi "[what]"
bankCabinet_e46c2695	bi	I looked through all the cabinets quickly, but didn't see anything out of the ordinary.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	979	bi "[what]"
bankPhotos_23c6bfca	bi	Offices always have photos on the wall.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	987	bi "[what]"
bankPhotos_b4f26027	bi	They're kind of cool to look at the first time but after that...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	988	bi "[what]"
bankPhotos_04ce8014	bi	It's still a bank, it's always going to be at least a little bit dreary.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	989	bi "[what]"
bankBathrooms_b36566cc	bi	I guess I need to search the bathrooms...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1032	bi "[what]"
bankBathrooms_936db95e	bi	I checked them out, but couldn't find anything.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1034	bi "[what]"
bankBathrooms_94233eab	bi	Makes sense that there's nothing in there.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1038	bi "[what]"
bankBathrooms_8a1643c9	bi	Jenny would have been in here.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1039	bi "[what]"
bankBathrooms_fb058948	bi	So either she's the murderer or she might have bumped into someone hiding stuff in here.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1040	bi "[what]"
bankBathrooms_67fa4e40	bi	Hopefully no one flushed something important...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1041	bi "[what]"
bankBathrooms_3b056351	bi	There's not a whole lot in this room... I think I've checked everything.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1043	bi "[what]"
bankBathrooms_c0958e63	bi	Time to go to the next location.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1044	bi "[what]"
bankLockers_fe54b637	bi	When Jenny and I came here earlier, every locker had a uniform in it.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1054	bi "[what]"
bankLockers_312ad896	bi	Now, one is missing, the one on Sam's body.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1055	bi "[what]"
bankLockers_a3b0de2c	bi	The lockers...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1057	bi "[what]"
bankLockers_bed9e7be	bi	Thankfully I have all the keys.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1058	bi "[what]"
bankLockers_58c71ae8	bi	Otherwise, there could be lots of evidence hidden in them that we'd never find.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1059	bi "[what]"
bankLockers_c651d49b	bi	Jenny took a bit of a risk having me be the one to hold on to them...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1060	bi "[what]"
bankLockers_8898fe93	bi	Though I guess if a locker was locked and I suddenly didn't have one of the keys, it would be obvious I did it.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1061	bi "[what]"
bankLockers_6f2a542a	bi	Anyway, I should look through them to be sure.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1062	bi "[what]"
bankLockers_ac2f74b9	bi	...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1063	bi "[what]"
bankLockers_ede15025	bi	When Jenny and I were first in here, each locker had a guard uniform.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1064	bi "[what]"
bankLockers_6e9f2c4d	bi	Now, one of those is missing, the one Sam is wearing.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1065	bi "[what]"
bankLockers_a8dbc01d	bi	Does that mean Sam was in the locker room at some point?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1066	bi "[what]"
bankLockers_a9e7e7a7	blank	Uniforms in the Lockers was added to evidence.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1071	blank "[what]"
bankLockers_3b056351	bi	There's not a whole lot in this room... I think I've checked everything.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1073	bi "[what]"
bankLockers_c0958e63	bi	Time to go to the next location.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1074	bi "[what]"
safeFirst_90542569	bi	Well... the safe is open.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1083	bi "[what]"
safeFirst_9efb19f3	bi	Who opened it?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1084	bi "[what]"
safeFirst_4afef52d	bi	As far as I know, no one that's alive has been in here...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1085	bi "[what]"
safeFirst_9f4040e4	bi	Did two people give up their birthdays?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1086	bi "[what]"
safeFirst_1bcc445a	bi	Did Sam open it before dying?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1087	bi "[what]"
safeFirst_40010ee1	bi	Or is someone lying?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1088	bi "[what]"
safeFirst_0a82edee	bi	Also, that note said...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1089	bi "[what]"
safeFirst_56e505df	bi	"The vault contains not only a substantial fortune, but also the true secrets of this game."	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1090	bi "[what]"
safeFirst_a8a2d986	bi	It's so empty... there's no way I don't find everything in here in just a few minutes, right?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1091	bi "[what]"
safeFirst_8416c42e	bi	Am I going to unlock the answers we've been looking for?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1092	bi "[what]"
safeFirst_96b50333	bi	I guess regardless, I'd better get in there and start searching...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1093	bi "[what]"
bankSafeCabinet_82f34e07	bi	Another filing cabinet.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1140	bi "[what]"
bankSafeCabinet_db9ec753	bi	Hopefully this one isn't full of papers that I have to read through.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1141	bi "[what]"
bankSafeCabinet_e32798cf	bi	If only Shahar was here... lawyers are good at reading through pages of boring text, right?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1142	bi "[what]"
bankSafeCabinet_ac2f74b9	bi	...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1143	bi "[what]"
bankSafeCabinet_53c9373b	bi	Huh?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1144	bi "[what]"
bankSafeCabinet_40869bd8	bi	This drawer's empty.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1145	bi "[what]"
bankSafeCabinet_e063ea5c	bi	...So is this one.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1146	bi "[what]"
bankSafeCabinet_b72e0e1c	bi	In fact, all of them are.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1147	bi "[what]"
bankSafeCabinet_d4eba740	bi	Maybe there was money in here and someone took it?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1148	bi "[what]"
bankSafeCabinet_a572f4fc	bi	But then where is the money now? Unless it was like, ten dollars, it would be hard to hide.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1149	bi "[what]"
bankSafeCabinet_0fa41faf	bi	I guess unless I find another clue related to this cabinet, best not to worry about it for now.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1150	bi "[what]"
bankSafeCabinet_1e0096a8	bi	Well, I wasn't wrong about the safe not having much to search.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1152	bi "[what]"
bankSafeCabinet_c6b4de42	bi	Though, I'm wishing I found pretty much anything else in here...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1153	bi "[what]"
bankSafeCabinet_5a0e7a25	bi	Evidence, a secret of the game...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1154	bi "[what]"
bankSafeCabinet_2753d1b7	bi	Oh well.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1155	bi "[what]"
bankBox_045cbe30	bi	A box holding ammo.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1164	bi "[what]"
bankBox_b8e9bc4c	bi	The bullets come in sets of six.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1165	bi "[what]"
bankBox_03850410	bi	Each set is connected by a piece of metal, which lets you load six at once easily.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1166	bi "[what]"
bankBox_69050932	bi	But, I wasn't able to tear off individual bullets when I tried.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1167	bi "[what]"
bankBox_94ff8253	bi	Hm, what's in this box?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1169	bi "[what]"
bankBox_a643eaf6	blank	Click.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1170	blank "[what]"
bankBox_3c17620d	bi	Huh.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1171	bi "[what]"
bankBox_d586f8bc	bi	It's full of ammo, presumably for the gun.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1172	bi "[what]"
bankBox_a8da7cf1	bi	I guess that makes sense, we didn't see a gun or ammo until today, when the safe was first opened.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1173	bi "[what]"
bankBox_85ebf05f	bi	So it had to have come from in here.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1174	bi "[what]"
bankBox_73de2ccb	bi	Hm... this ammo is interesting though.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1175	bi "[what]"
bankBox_4226dfcf	bi	It doesn't come as single bullets, but in sets of six.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1176	bi "[what]"
bankBox_b1220548	bi	Each set is connected by a piece of metal that's shaped almost like a flower.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1177	bi "[what]"
bankBox_7e2d8645	bi	The bullets are attached to the metal piece on "leaves" of the flower.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1178	bi "[what]"
bankBox_3ff49ed6	bi	I guess, I've seen in games those devices that let you load multiple bullets at once.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1179	bi "[what]"
bankBox_088adf00	bi	It looks like those, except it's attached to the bullets.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1180	bi "[what]"
bankBox_f24ee61a	bi	I assume when you fire there's enough force that each individual bullet detaches.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1181	bi "[what]"
bankBox_0ff70c53	bi	I wonder...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1182	bi "[what]"
bankBox_0cc37e33	b	Urg.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1183	b "[what]"
bankBox_0a1d171d	b	Hhhhhhh.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1184	b "[what]"
bankBox_8b90cd22	b	ROAAAAAAAAAAARGH.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1185	b "[what]"
bankBox_5817891d	bi	...Damn.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1186	bi "[what]"
bankBox_da89ddee	bi	Either I'm weaker than I thought, or it's not humanly possible to tear off the bullets from the set.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1187	bi "[what]"
bankBox_40a69863	bi	So they have to be reloaded in sets of six...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1188	bi "[what]"
bankBox_b2428498	bi	That seems like it will be important to remember.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1189	bi "[what]"
bankBox_ce5de721	blank	Ammunition was added to evidence.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1194	blank "[what]"

bankBox_2753d1b7	bi	Oh well.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1199	bi "[what]"
bankSign_5100037c	bi	The sign on the safe says you can't unlock it from the inside.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1208	bi "[what]"
bankSign_0ea92400	bi	Jenny and I tested that and that's true.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1209	bi "[what]"
bankSign_ae7de4dd	bi	Also, we learned that the door opens and closes electronically once you pull or push it.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1210	bi "[what]"
bankSign_263c24c2	bi	And when it opens, it opens to a ninety degree angle.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1211	bi "[what]"

bankSign_3ef4349e	bi	Key word, by myself...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1220	bi "[what]"
bankSign_a2b0e6d8	bi	I ran to the lobby, grabbed Jenny, and brought her to the safe with me.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1222	bi "[what]"
bankSign_61f15c00	j	So... you brought me here to test something?	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1228	j "[what]"

bankSign_54db7c5f	j	You opened the safe door back to exactly a ninety degree angle.	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1278	j "[what]"

bankSign_07cf9b99	bi	That means if someone was in here earlier, they would either have been locked in or easily seen...	game/bankscreens-inv.rpy	1294	bi "[what]"

bertHang_c53d9de3	b	I don't know what it is, but I've really been craving pizza.	game/bert-fte.rpy	33	b "[what]"
bertHang_8596b3c0	b	Pizza with pineapple and pepperoni. And some garlic bread on the side.	game/bert-fte.rpy	39	b "[what]"
bertHang_801afb85	n	Why pineapple on pizza though?	game/bert-fte.rpy	40	n "[what]"
bertHang_983c5160	b	Hmm... it adds a nice sweet yet acidic flavor that compliments the meat and cheese.	game/bert-fte.rpy	42	b "[what]"
bertHang_e08e0d8e	n	Won't thinking about food in this much detail just make you hungrier?	game/bert-fte.rpy	43	n "[what]"
bertHang_129e8251	b	I guess so?	game/bert-fte.rpy	44	b "[what]"
bertHang_05a3089f	b	But at the same time, if I'm thinking about food I'm not freaking out.	game/bert-fte.rpy	45	b "[what]"
bertHang_f9dd8b60	b	And thinking about what I miss from home gives me motivation to work to get out.	game/bert-fte.rpy	46	b "[what]"
bertHang_8d0ef240	n	That's... a rather optimistic take, I guess.	game/bert-fte.rpy	47	n "[what]"

bertHang_dfccba0e	n	I don't think you're gonna like my answer.	game/bert-fte.rpy	53	n "[what]"
bertHang_f8a766de	b	Try me. Maybe you'll be surprised.	game/bert-fte.rpy	54	b "[what]"
bertHang_38c9c705	n	Honestly, I haven't had anything but gruel in... years.	game/bert-fte.rpy	55	n "[what]"
bertHang_c7566290	b	...gruel?	game/bert-fte.rpy	56	b "[what]"
bertHang_f6a99611	n	Basically something meant for sustenance like oats, but boiled.	game/bert-fte.rpy	57	n "[what]"

bertHang_64c0f794	n	...though in my childhood I really liked deep dish pizza.	game/bert-fte.rpy	67	n "[what]"
bertHang_f2476671	b	Oh?	game/bert-fte.rpy	68	b "[what]"
bertHang_6ea17718	n	Yeah. our local pizza place sold thin crust by the pizza and deep dish by the slice.	game/bert-fte.rpy	69	n "[what]"
bertHang_665af2a7	n	I couldn't finish a whole pizza by myself and I liked weird toppings.	game/bert-fte.rpy	70	n "[what]"
bertHang_8cd3dea6	n	So I'd get deep dish so I could eat it without sharing.	game/bert-fte.rpy	71	n "[what]"
bertHang_f6c2b881	b	Weird toppings?	game/bert-fte.rpy	72	b "[what]"
bertHang_c2fc074c	n	I loved anchovies as a kid.	game/bert-fte.rpy	73	n "[what]"
bertHang_8c2d10e2	n	These days... I've wisened up a bit.	game/bert-fte.rpy	74	n "[what]"
bertHang_feab16af	b	Understandable. I imagine after eating gruel that much salt is shocking.	game/bert-fte.rpy	75	b "[what]"
bertHang_bb2cf764	n	...	game/bert-fte.rpy	76	n "[what]"
bertHang_47ab4966	b	...Sorry, probably shouldn't have brought that up again.	game/bert-fte.rpy	78	b "[what]"

bertHang_d47bcb8f	n	Hey Bert, we talked about the food we'd eat when we get out.	game/bert-fte.rpy	87	n "[what]"
bertHang_5cc372d0	n	But do you really think we're going to get out?	game/bert-fte.rpy	88	n "[what]"
bertHang_a32b0b68	b	Geez, that's a heavy question to start a conversation with.	game/bert-fte.rpy	90	b "[what]"
bertHang_d0383daa	n	Sorry, I'm not good at conversation.	game/bert-fte.rpy	91	n "[what]"
bertHang_5971a212	b	Nah, it's fine. Just a bit of a ramp up from pizza.	game/bert-fte.rpy	92	b "[what]"
bertHang_6632242b	b	But we... kill the Game Master, then we get out, right?	game/bert-fte.rpy	93	b "[what]"
bertHang_f06f66c4	ni	He hesitated before the word killed.	game/bert-fte.rpy	94	ni "[what]"
bertHang_4a8ba0d1	b	Imagine we work together to figure out who the Game Master is.	game/bert-fte.rpy	95	b "[what]"
bertHang_69ab5762	b	It'll require some hard honest conversations about ourselves, of course.	game/bert-fte.rpy	96	b "[what]"
bertHang_f3a3f28c	b	But we could maybe get out in just a few hours if we do!	game/bert-fte.rpy	98	b "[what]"
bertHang_c16a5e47	n	How would we be able to identify the Game Master in just a few hours of talking though?	game/bert-fte.rpy	99	n "[what]"
bertHang_0acafded	n	We don't know their motives for playing this game...	game/bert-fte.rpy	100	n "[what]"
bertHang_da31992b	n	We don't know how we ended up here...	game/bert-fte.rpy	101	n "[what]"
bertHang_69d42f21	n	We don't even know where we are!	game/bert-fte.rpy	102	n "[what]"
bertHang_f24e5c27	b	You're not wrong.	game/bert-fte.rpy	104	b "[what]"
bertHang_4720c600	b	But not all problems can be solved like a homework problem in a few minutes.	game/bert-fte.rpy	105	b "[what]"
bertHang_37da61c3	b	Unless the Game Master picked 12 arbitrary people, there has to be some answer.	game/bert-fte.rpy	106	b "[what]"
bertHang_417a11f9	b	We just have to work hard and work together to find it.	game/bert-fte.rpy	107	b "[what]"
bertHang_220234a2	b	The alternative is we just sit around hoping things work out.	game/bert-fte.rpy	108	b "[what]"
bertHang_97532153	n	Surely it won't be that easy.	game/bert-fte.rpy	109	n "[what]"
bertHang_7ee2419d	n	If I was running a game like this, I would do everything to disguise myself.	game/bert-fte.rpy	111	n "[what]"
bertHang_fc0c6577	n	The person running this game has the ability to knock us out at will.	game/bert-fte.rpy	112	n "[what]"
bertHang_c9449efa	n	They commandeered this train all by themselves!	game/bert-fte.rpy	113	n "[what]"
bertHang_8bbd50fa	n	There's no way they would be careless enough to let us find out who they are on day one.	game/bert-fte.rpy	114	n "[what]"
bertHang_850ef128_1	b	...	game/bert-fte.rpy	115	b "[what]"
bertHang_39f620e5	b	...You're being kind of a bummer right now.	game/bert-fte.rpy	121	b "[what]"
bertHang_33d36d5f	n	Huh?	game/bert-fte.rpy	122	n "[what]"
bertHang_ffeb2157	b	Being pessimistic isn't going to get us out of here.	game/bert-fte.rpy	124	b "[what]"
bertHang_0edd232f	b	If we just lay down and accept our fate, then our chances of getting out are smaller.	game/bert-fte.rpy	125	b "[what]"
bertHang_6d902ff3	b	It feels like you're not looking for sympathy here.	game/bert-fte.rpy	126	b "[what]"
bertHang_83d53484	b	So all you're doing is dragging me down with you.	game/bert-fte.rpy	127	b "[what]"
bertHang_5862f134	n	...That's fair, I guess.	game/bert-fte.rpy	129	n "[what]"
bertHang_fa25d1be	n	Earlier, you hesitated to say "killed.	game/bert-fte.rpy	130	n "[what]"

bertHang_dd642154	n	Like I said, not good at conversation.	game/bert-fte.rpy	132	n "[what]"
bertHang_bd254697	b	Yeah, I don't like the word killed.	game/bert-fte.rpy	133	b "[what]"
bertHang_3a06c49e	b	I have a... complicated relationship with murder and things like that.	game/bert-fte.rpy	134	b "[what]"

bertHang_bb2cf764_1	n	...	game/bert-fte.rpy	138	n "[what]"
bertHang_93d55f1f	n	I guess we should meet up with the others now.	game/bert-fte.rpy	139	n "[what]"

go_f79be9da	n	And I'm not the same person now that I was before.	game/case0.rpy	679	n "[what]"
go_ace98718	n	So I feel guilty, but I'd like to leave it in the past, and live life as a new me who learned from my mistakes.	game/case0.rpy	680	n "[what]"
go_3eece2df	n	Isn't that what the prison system's for?	game/case0.rpy	681	n "[what]"
go_6b2e1a78	z	I see.	game/case0.rpy	682	z "[what]"
go_e985eda6	z	Was anyone harmed by your past crimes?	game/case0.rpy	683	z "[what]"
go_ea27dd86	n	Well... they weren't exactly victimless crimes.	game/case0.rpy	684	n "[what]"
go_715e95d9	z	Do you think the people who were harmed could leave it in the past?	game/case0.rpy	685	z "[what]"
go_1351c423	n	...No, I guess that would be pretty difficult.	game/case0.rpy	686	n "[what]"
go_5679b446	z	What about their loved ones? People who depended on them?	game/case0.rpy	687	z "[what]"
go_433107e8	z	Do you think they can so easily forgive and forget?	game/case0.rpy	688	z "[what]"
go_f6de8410	n	What's your point?	game/case0.rpy	689	n "[what]"
go_1865907a	z	What makes you think you have the right to forgive yourself if those people could never forgive you?	game/case0.rpy	690	z "[what]"
go_0b29abf2	n	That's... a bit of a leading question.	game/case0.rpy	691	n "[what]"
go_6b2e1a78_1	z	I see.	game/case0.rpy	692	z "[what]"
go_6d991955	z	Well then, let's not waste anymore time here.	game/case0.rpy	693	z "[what]"
go_f591d853	z	You have plenty of hard work ahead of you...	game/case0.rpy	694	z "[what]"
go_980e5222	z	Come with me.	game/case0.rpy	699	z "[what]"
go_484af4b2	ni	They extended their hand.	game/case0.rpy	700	ni "[what]"
go_eca41fff	ni	Who... who is this?	game/case0.rpy	701	ni "[what]"
go_406a6e61	ni	Should I go with them?	game/case0.rpy	702	ni "[what]"

go_bb2cf764_1	n	...	game/case0.rpy	707	n "[what]"
go_093c6a2c	n	Okay.	game/case0.rpy	709	n "[what]"
go_8e1731aa	ni	I reached out and grabbed the hand.	game/case0.rpy	710	ni "[what]"
go_d972c935	n	I... don't trust you.	game/case0.rpy	714	n "[what]"
go_d89c2d32	z	I'm sorry.	game/case0.rpy	715	z "[what]"
go_8bcfe562	z	But it is not an option.	game/case0.rpy	716	z "[what]"
go_cd2929b2	ni	...Somehow I felt compelled to grab the hand, despite my brain saying otherwise.	game/case0.rpy	717	ni "[what]"
go_2b584c74	ni	Everything went dark.	game/case0.rpy	738	ni "[what]"
go_538cfeab	z	I will remember that decision.	game/case0.rpy	739	z "[what]"
go_4a662365	z	Even if you don't.	game/case0.rpy	740	z "[what]"
go_85440472	ni	My thoughts started to fade slowly.	game/case0.rpy	741	ni "[what]"
go_12405e1a	ni	My consciousness, my ability to process what was happening to me.	game/case0.rpy	742	ni "[what]"

go_d15638b8	ni	Last thing I remember... I was in my cell being told I'd get out.	game/case0.rpy	770	ni "[what]"
go_f6460e80	ni	The warden called for me and told me I was being released...	game/case0.rpy	771	ni "[what]"
go_47a403b5	ni	...why can't I remember anything past that?	game/case0.rpy	772	ni "[what]"
go_df5c3063	ni	Now I'm on the floor in what looks like a little cell.	game/case0.rpy	773	ni "[what]"
go_0f9b4443	ni	Hmmm... I don't have anything with me.	game/case0.rpy	775	ni "[what]"
go_c3667574	ni	Not even ID in my pockets. Someone must have taken it from me.	game/case0.rpy	776	ni "[what]"
go_d9fc85fc	ni	What's going on here?	game/case0.rpy	777	ni "[what]"
go_ae9c61aa	ni	What was that sound?	game/case0.rpy	780	ni "[what]"
go_58c860a8	ni	Oh, it came from that door. It sounds like it unlocked...	game/case0.rpy	781	ni "[what]"
go_45f850c9	ni	Let's see what's on the other side...	game/case0.rpy	782	ni "[what]"
go_b76e8b2d	ni	I pushed the door open into a larger, circular room.	game/case0.rpy	784	ni "[what]"
go_661333e1	ni	Just as I did, so did eleven other people.	game/case0.rpy	785	ni "[what]"
go_57e740f7	ni	It seems like they all came from their own room, like myself.	game/case0.rpy	786	ni "[what]"
go_7e20a1cb	ni	I quickly glanced around to familiarize myself with everyone.	game/case0.rpy	795	ni "[what]"
go_ee95a123	ni	First was a guy with a backpack. He looked like... just a regular guy.	game/case0.rpy	800	ni "[what]"
go_5aaf8e14	ni	Nothing wrong with that. Definitely a much better first impression than I probably gave.	game/case0.rpy	801	ni "[what]"
go_50213a87	ni	Not the most intimidating but not meek either, I could work with that.	game/case0.rpy	803	ni "[what]"
go_8e22c257	ni	Second, there was someone who looked to be in their early 20s.	game/case0.rpy	807	ni "[what]"
go_d82fdd6d	ni	Their figure was somewhat petite, but their resting expression was a very stern one.	game/case0.rpy	808	ni "[what]"
go_5c5de8a3	ni	Not threatening per se, but a clear signal not to step on their toes.	game/case0.rpy	809	ni "[what]"
go_67c5e9b1	ni	Next was a woman in a suit. She looked to be in her late 20s, like me. It was hard to read her expression.	game/case0.rpy	813	ni "[what]"
go_bc7911cc	ni	Her outfit made it seem like she would be very serious, but the way her eyes flicked around...	game/case0.rpy	814	ni "[what]"
go_8ba3355a	ni	She was definitely checking some of the men in the room out.	game/case0.rpy	815	ni "[what]"
go_329005d1	ni	I was mildly offended when she made eye contact with me and then quickly looked away.	game/case0.rpy	816	ni "[what]"
go_6f31a8ac	ni	Next to her was a kid. He seemed more confused than the rest of us.	game/case0.rpy	824	ni "[what]"
go_6da8d244	ni	His outfit was... unusual. Like his wardrobe was made of hand-me-downs and he was worried it would rain.	game/case0.rpy	825	ni "[what]"
go_45765034	ni	Judging by the nametag, his name was Sid. If he's wearing a name tag, he was probably at a job before this?	game/case0.rpy	826	ni "[what]"
go_318b1643	ni	Next was a fashionable girl. Probably a college student.	game/case0.rpy	830	ni "[what]"
go_a6efe024	ni	Unlike most of us, she seemed to be lost in thought rather than trying to make sense of the situation.	game/case0.rpy	831	ni "[what]"
go_ac057f1d	ni	A lot of the the guys were glancing at her.	game/case0.rpy	832	ni "[what]"
go_2ca4e705	ni	Next was a... woman? In a crop top holding a cat. Honestly, she could have been 15 or 35, it was hard to tell.	game/case0.rpy	836	ni "[what]"
go_0f1ece33	ni	You know how they say pet owners tend to look like their pets?	game/case0.rpy	837	ni "[what]"
go_0c5363a3	ni	She definitely looked to me like a cat. For a second, I thought she even had narrow pupils.	game/case0.rpy	838	ni "[what]"
go_475a15f6	ni	Like the previous girl, she was much more preoccupied with her cat than the current situation.	game/case0.rpy	839	ni "[what]"
go_ecffbd09	ni	Towering over the women was a blonde man. His glasses were very reflective, so it was hard to read his expression.	game/case0.rpy	847	ni "[what]"
go_d0eb6147	ni	His posture was very confident, but besides that I couldn't really tell what to make of him.	game/case0.rpy	848	ni "[what]"
go_8791b10f	ni	And then there was definitely the oldest one here, a... vampire looking dude?	game/case0.rpy	852	ni "[what]"
go_4e5bc224	ni	Not that any of us knew what was going on, but he definitely gave off a creepy vibe.	game/case0.rpy	853	ni "[what]"
go_1a91b57a	ni	...Seriously though, what's with the outfit?	game/case0.rpy	854	ni "[what]"
go_cee3d6d2	ni	It's like a cross between a Halloween costume and high fashion.	game/case0.rpy	855	ni "[what]"
go_ab0a7f0c	ni	Moving on, another woman. She gave off much more chill vibes.	game/case0.rpy	859	ni "[what]"
go_b043fc10	ni	She doesn't look as airheaded as the other girls.	game/case0.rpy	860	ni "[what]"
go_2f39c94e	ni	Her cropped hoodie says "SAB", very very faintly. I wonder what that means.	game/case0.rpy	861	ni "[what]"
go_a28caa94	ni	Next was... okay, honestly I wasn't sure what that was.	game/case0.rpy	869	ni "[what]"
go_92956ee6	ni	Was it a robot? A child in a frog costume?	game/case0.rpy	870	ni "[what]"
go_589970f5	ni	I'm just going to assume it's a kid. But the outfit they're wearing makes it hard to tell anything else about them.	game/case0.rpy	871	ni "[what]"
go_c15dde84	ni	Last was a... pretty much half-naked man. His outfit was about as out-of-place as the vampire's.	game/case0.rpy	874	ni "[what]"
go_748d735a	ni	Maybe it really was Halloween before we all were gathered here.	game/case0.rpy	875	ni "[what]"
go_efff063f	ni	I was hoping to get good reads on everyone, but this guy, the frog, and the vampire threw that out the window.	game/case0.rpy	876	ni "[what]"
go_02ab4ae9	ni	My people watching session was quickly interrupted by someone finally finding the courage to speak up.	game/case0.rpy	880	ni "[what]"
go_0f822440	zs	I'm assuming you're all as confused as I am, so let's get straight to figuring things out.	game/case0.rpy	883	zs "[what]"
go_eb06ce9b	zs	Anyone know where we are or why we're here?	game/case0.rpy	884	zs "[what]"
go_0cbc518f	zc	No clue. The last thing I remember I was out for a walk, totally fine.	game/case0.rpy	890	zc "[what]"
go_13ca468b	zc	After that, my memory is a haze. It's like I suddenly took a nap and woke up here.	game/case0.rpy	891	zc "[what]"
go_83e76173	ni	A few people spoke up at once agreeing.	game/case0.rpy	892	ni "[what]"
go_b0a8e28b	zs	So no one knows how they got here, and there's probably gaps in our memory...	game/case0.rpy	897	zs "[what]"
go_24a22a72	zs	Does anyone recognize anyone else in here?	game/case0.rpy	898	zs "[what]"
go_bfba11c2	ni	A few people were starting to raise their hands...	game/case0.rpy	899	ni "[what]"
go_82681c8c	zt	Besides the world-famous businesswoman, who I'm sure we've all seen on TV.	game/case0.rpy	905	zt "[what]"
go_df1678ba	ni	A bunch of people were staring at her.	game/case0.rpy	906	ni "[what]"
go_53677e44	ni	After that clarification the hands shot back down.	game/case0.rpy	907	ni "[what]"
go_355b7f5f	zs	So no one personally knows each other, I see. Not even as friends of friends or connections of that sort.	game/case0.rpy	912	zs "[what]"
go_abac42b9	zs	In that case, I think it's fair to assume we've been placed here against our will then.	game/case0.rpy	918	zs "[what]"
go_6e199cfe	zs	That is to say, we've probably been kidnapped by someone with an unknown motive.	game/case0.rpy	919	zs "[what]"
go_b480bd56	ni	I think we all knew this on some level, but several people's expressions sunk upon hearing that.	game/case0.rpy	921	ni "[what]"
go_5f457af4	ni	Mine not so much. This wasn't much more hopeless than being in a jail cell.	game/case0.rpy	922	ni "[what]"
go_dc426172	ni	But at least... some of these people seemed to be ordinary people.	game/case0.rpy	923	ni "[what]"
go_7fab937e	ni	This was probably the first time most of them had been trapped in a situation like this.	game/case0.rpy	924	ni "[what]"
go_a4d2a5be	zi	Umm... does anyone have a phone? Or something else like that?	game/case0.rpy	930	zi "[what]"
go_cd26a7ac	ni	A few people instinctively checked their pockets.	game/case0.rpy	931	ni "[what]"
go_108522cd	ni	A few others made it clear they had checked a few times already.	game/case0.rpy	932	ni "[what]"
go_529bb46d	zi	I normally always have my phone on me...	game/case0.rpy	933	zi "[what]"
go_6e678b88	zs	Yeah, same. Someone must have taken all of our belongings.	game/case0.rpy	934	zs "[what]"
go_ea2c9dd2	zi	Th-that's... yeah.	game/case0.rpy	935	zi "[what]"
go_abc9bed8	zs	Hmmm...	game/case0.rpy	940	zs "[what]"
go_97c31420	zs	Until we have more information, it's probably best to assume our lives are in some sort of danger while we are here.	game/case0.rpy	941	zs "[what]"
go_aaec3c42	zs	In which case I think we should look around and try to find a way out or some answers.	game/case0.rpy	942	zs "[what]"
go_232fbc3d	zs	Any objections?	game/case0.rpy	943	zs "[what]"
go_15356e82	ni	Again, silence.	game/case0.rpy	944	ni "[what]"
go_43c7e864	zs	Alright, let's look around then.	game/case0.rpy	945	zs "[what]"
go_84b5f679	ni	We looked around for a bit.	game/case0.rpy	949	ni "[what]"
go_d9aafd13	ni	But it quickly became clear there was nothing to find or see here.	game/case0.rpy	950	ni "[what]"
go_99a8ec3b	ni	It sounds like we all woke up in this same type of room with no notable features.	game/case0.rpy	951	ni "[what]"
go_f316cee3	ni	And then the central room connecting them all also had no notable features.	game/case0.rpy	952	ni "[what]"
go_0e463aa0	ni	It was the most nondescript building I'd even been in.	game/case0.rpy	953	ni "[what]"
go_2121de45	ni	Even prison had more character than this room.	game/case0.rpy	954	ni "[what]"
go_28bb37c8	ni	The only really notable feature of this building seemed to be there was no exit.	game/case0.rpy	955	ni "[what]"
go_c7939432	ni	At least, none we could use.	game/case0.rpy	956	ni "[what]"
go_c9899792	zs	Anyone have anything to report?	game/case0.rpy	959	zs "[what]"
go_20d76f24	zf	Umm... kinda.	game/case0.rpy	965	zf "[what]"
go_26064ead	zf	I'm scared... I miss my mom...	game/case0.rpy	970	zf "[what]"
go_470d22a1	zs	Not sure that counts as finding something...	game/case0.rpy	971	zs "[what]"
go_2c1a16e7	ni	So it is a little boy in the frog suit.	game/case0.rpy	973	ni "[what]"
go_4e91777a	n	Why are you wearing that anyway, kid?	game/case0.rpy	974	n "[what]"
go_efd2b311	zf	It makes me feel safe... I'm just a little frog.	game/case0.rpy	975	zf "[what]"
go_dd7080e1	zs	Just try to stay calm for now and the adults will figure this out.	game/case0.rpy	976	zs "[what]"
go_66e1fa89	zf	O-okay.	game/case0.rpy	977	zf "[what]"
go_03b9f4bf	zs	Anyway, it doesn't seem like anyone found anything useful.	game/case0.rpy	981	zs "[what]"
go_a15a93cd	zs	In that case, does anyone have a particularly good sense of hearing?	game/case0.rpy	982	zs "[what]"
go_48f3caf4	zs	Perhaps if we listen closely to the walls we will get a sense of whether we're in civilization or not.	game/case0.rpy	983	zs "[what]"
go_c8188f19	zs	If so, then we could reason about our chances of getting help from the authorities.	game/case0.rpy	984	zs "[what]"
go_b2cb0029	zc	I think first we should all introduce ourselves!	game/case0.rpy	990	zc "[what]"
go_8201fae5	zc	It seems like we're stuck in here for the moment, it'd be good to know who we're stuck with.	game/case0.rpy	991	zc "[what]"
go_fd13c4c0	zd	I agree. I don't know how to address any of you.	game/case0.rpy	995	zd "[what]"
go_68a35dc1	zd	It'll be hard for us to work together without some sense of camaraderie.	game/case0.rpy	996	zd "[what]"
go_26e1c41c	zs	Alright, let's take some time to talk to each other.	game/case0.rpy	1001	zs "[what]"
go_2f558367	ni	Hmm... I don't love making small talk, but I need to blend in at least.	game/case0.rpy	1002	ni "[what]"
go_1541a8a6	ni	Let's meet everyone.	game/case0.rpy	1003	ni "[what]"
go_6b7a7a14	tut	Throughout the game, when a character is present in a room, their icon will appear in the top left.	game/case0.rpy	1005	tut "[what]"
go_6a5d05cf	tut	In some segments you will gain control of the story, and can choose who to talk to.	game/case0.rpy	1006	tut "[what]"
go_af4e1a8b	tut	To talk to a character, click on their icon in the top left.	game/case0.rpy	1007	tut "[what]"
go_70c72ea9	tut	Ask everyone at least one question to progress the story. You can ask more if you're interested.	game/case0.rpy	1008	tut "[what]"
postMeetings_bef53b3d	ni	And I've met everyone. Looks like the group is reconvening to discuss now.	game/case0.rpy	1015	ni "[what]"
postMeetings_d6076bc2	s	Okay, now that that's done, I think we should look around and try-	game/case0.rpy	1018	s "[what]"

hospitalGo_8ba6c4d7	bi	It opened into a hallway.	game/hospital.rpy	126	bi "[what]"
hospitalGo_735d0442	bi	There were three other cells in this hallway.	game/hospital.rpy	127	bi "[what]"

hospitalGo_48dfecf7	bi	From this hallway, you couldn't really see the bed.	game/hospital.rpy	133	bi "[what]"
hospitalGo_a1a845ab	bi	Some of them might have had people sleeping that I just couldn't see.	game/hospital.rpy	134	bi "[what]"
hospitalGo_0d381aea	bi	I guess we'll all convene eventually...	game/hospital.rpy	135	bi "[what]"
hospitalGo_ac566ef0	bi	With those observations, I opened the door to the larger room...	game/hospital.rpy	136	bi "[what]"
hospitalGo_e424cfc5	bi	The hallway opened up into what looked like a middle school cafeteria.	game/hospital.rpy	142	bi "[what]"
hospitalGo_bf28937f	bi	There, I saw a few of the others gathered.	game/hospital.rpy	143	bi "[what]"

hospitalGo_cd1de32c	b	Is his everyone who's awake?	game/hospital.rpy	147	b "[what]"
hospitalGo_60fc22f8	l	So far, yeah.	game/hospital.rpy	148	l "[what]"
hospitalGo_781c9fbf	bi	Sam was looking at a series of... photo composites on on wall.	game/hospital.rpy	149	bi "[what]"
hospitalGo_4a37eb97	bi	On another wall was a sign.	game/hospital.rpy	150	bi "[what]"
hospitalGo_aeae84c7	bi	It read "Rules of the Latimer Mental Hospital" at the top.	game/hospital.rpy	151	bi "[what]"
hospitalGo_94169c85	bi	...Mental hospital?	game/hospital.rpy	152	bi "[what]"
hospitalGo_650a595c	bi	I guess... in a demented sense, a mental hospital is like a prison.	game/hospital.rpy	153	bi "[what]"
hospitalGo_2cf2f816	bi	Dracula was reading through that one.	game/hospital.rpy	154	bi "[what]"
hospitalGo_abb9b653	b	How much looking around have you all done?	game/hospital.rpy	155	b "[what]"
hospitalGo_c6fd0577	l	Not much personally.	game/hospital.rpy	156	l "[what]"
hospitalGo_af14cbbb	b	You also just got here?	game/hospital.rpy	157	b "[what]"
hospitalGo_8b350106	l	Nah, I got up about 10 minutes ago.	game/hospital.rpy	158	l "[what]"
hospitalGo_9d374970	l	When I got here, Sid was the only one waiting. Dracula arrived a few minutes later.	game/hospital.rpy	159	l "[what]"
hospitalGo_3b147291	l	I've been... thinking.	game/hospital.rpy	160	l "[what]"
hospitalGo_1e6872f1	b	Thinking?	game/hospital.rpy	161	b "[what]"
hospitalGo_c38129cd	l	About Sam. What to say, how this affects the rest of us, all that.	game/hospital.rpy	162	l "[what]"
hospitalGo_1a2b5f0f	s	It should be me who's dead now...	game/hospital.rpy	168	s "[what]"
hospitalGo_b22b7ac6	bi	Oh, right. Sam tried to kill Stella.	game/hospital.rpy	173	bi "[what]"
hospitalGo_40370fb3	bi	And probably didn't feel very good about it now.	game/hospital.rpy	174	bi "[what]"
hospitalGo_cc280f79	bi	We didn't really have time to debrief after figuring out it was Catherine who did it.	game/hospital.rpy	175	bi "[what]"
hospitalGo_a22f3b5f	bi	The Game Master couldn't even spare us that brief favor.	game/hospital.rpy	176	bi "[what]"
hospitalGo_196e109e	l	Anyway, you shouldn't worry about that.	game/hospital.rpy	177	l "[what]"
hospitalGo_a2ee2652	l	Go do your investigation thing, figure out everything for the rest of us.	game/hospital.rpy	178	l "[what]"
hospitalGo_dd453fad	bi	...I couldn't tell if she was patronizing me or complimenting me.	game/hospital.rpy	179	bi "[what]"
hospitalGo_d804c6e6	b	Sounds good, seeya Lauren.	game/hospital.rpy	180	b "[what]"
hospitalGo_587f0124	bi	Looking around, the room didn't really have much besides tables.	game/hospital.rpy	182	bi "[what]"
hospitalGo_0d435da0	bi	So the only things to look at were the photo composites on the wall, and the sign with the rules.	game/hospital.rpy	183	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_43b5e617	bi	I joined Sid by the photo composites.	game/hospital.rpy	190	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_00427ede	i	Hey Bert.	game/hospital.rpy	192	i "[what]"
picsorrules_683ba221	b	Hey Sid. What's happening here?	game/hospital.rpy	193	b "[what]"
picsorrules_df3ca8b2	i	It seems like every year they put up a photo of everyone who got discharged that year.	game/hospital.rpy	194	i "[what]"
picsorrules_11d8a18f	bi	Each photo composite had about 50 or so photos on it.	game/hospital.rpy	195	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_edece9c6	b	Must be a pretty small hospital, if only this many people cycle per year...	game/hospital.rpy	196	b "[what]"
picsorrules_f5230b70	i	It's kind of nice, in a way.	game/hospital.rpy	197	i "[what]"
picsorrules_4e1bf2ab	b	Nice?	game/hospital.rpy	198	b "[what]"
picsorrules_dd4a61d2	i	Having the photos of others who've made it out there.	game/hospital.rpy	199	i "[what]"
picsorrules_691dabf4	i	It's like... a reminder to patients that that they could do it, and so you can you.	game/hospital.rpy	200	i "[what]"
picsorrules_cb3e143f	b	If only we had people who escaped this game before to motivate us the same way...	game/hospital.rpy	201	b "[what]"
picsorrules_2e3f082c	i	...Do you think this game is recurring?	game/hospital.rpy	202	i "[what]"
picsorrules_30940e96	b	Oh no, I was just making a joke.	game/hospital.rpy	203	b "[what]"
picsorrules_75649e44	i	I saw a drama on TV like this...	game/hospital.rpy	204	i "[what]"
picsorrules_ac49dda4	i	It was about bunch of people competing in a life-or-death versions of children's games for a lot of money.	game/hospital.rpy	205	i "[what]"
picsorrules_30b5abf4	i	They had one every year in the show, and one of the winners of the previous games ran the game now.	game/hospital.rpy	206	i "[what]"
picsorrules_3677fb93	i	What if this game we're in repeats every year?	game/hospital.rpy	207	i "[what]"
picsorrules_9219f25e	i	Maybe the Game Master is a past winner?	game/hospital.rpy	208	i "[what]"
picsorrules_1e73dae2	b	Sid... no offense, but that's just something on TV.	game/hospital.rpy	209	b "[what]"
picsorrules_bf17526a	b	I don't think it has anything to do with our situation.	game/hospital.rpy	210	b "[what]"
picsorrules_68dc5531	i	Yeah, you're probably right.	game/hospital.rpy	211	i "[what]"
picsorrules_94a8114f	b	Have you taken a close look at the photos yet?	game/hospital.rpy	212	b "[what]"
picsorrules_948724a8	b	Maybe someone one of us knows is one of the photos?	game/hospital.rpy	213	b "[what]"
picsorrules_0c445f4c	i	I haven't looked in a lot of detail, but I haven't recognized anyone, no...	game/hospital.rpy	214	i "[what]"
picsorrules_84499615	b	Hmm okay, guess I'll take a closer look myself.	game/hospital.rpy	215	b "[what]"
picsorrules_ac2f74b9	bi	...	game/hospital.rpy	216	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_edc31504	bi	No, I don't recognize anyone on this one...	game/hospital.rpy	217	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_8ed2a3ed	bi	Not that I should, it's from a year before I was born...	game/hospital.rpy	218	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_470830ad	bi	I read through a few more, but didn't recognize any of the names or faces.	game/hospital.rpy	219	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_53c9373b	bi	Huh?	game/hospital.rpy	220	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_1d401757	bi	There's one from four years ago, and two years ago...	game/hospital.rpy	221	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_fe24c457	bi	But not three years ago.	game/hospital.rpy	222	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_cd706720	bi	There's even an empty spot in the line where one should be...	game/hospital.rpy	223	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_41ea1e01	b	Sid, did you see a photo composite from three years ago?	game/hospital.rpy	224	b "[what]"
picsorrules_04625e74	i	Um... no, but they're chronologically ordered, so it should be easy to find it?	game/hospital.rpy	225	i "[what]"
picsorrules_a9d4b152	b	I think it's missing...	game/hospital.rpy	226	b "[what]"
picsorrules_ce426312	i	Huh. Do you think one of us got rid of it?	game/hospital.rpy	227	i "[what]"
picsorrules_3425e004	b	You were the first one to get here, right?	game/hospital.rpy	228	b "[what]"
picsorrules_103772a1	i	Yeah, pretty much as soon as I woke up I came here.	game/hospital.rpy	229	i "[what]"
picsorrules_ca9c3685	i	So I guess there wasn't time for someone to come and remove it?	game/hospital.rpy	230	i "[what]"
picsorrules_f8bc5ca6	b	Maybe, maybe not...	game/hospital.rpy	231	b "[what]"
picsorrules_2d1ef5b0	b	We don't really know anything about how us waking up in a new location works.	game/hospital.rpy	232	b "[what]"
picsorrules_176a3493	b	Do we all wake up at the same time or is it like taking a nap?	game/hospital.rpy	233	b "[what]"
picsorrules_f4b1f1f5	i	Hm... maybe the person whose turn it is to murder is on the missing composite?	game/hospital.rpy	234	i "[what]"
picsorrules_234f73ef	i	Or maybe it's the Game Master and they deliberately removed it!	game/hospital.rpy	235	i "[what]"
picsorrules_42a29935	b	Yeah, there's gotta be a reason that specific year's is missing...	game/hospital.rpy	236	b "[what]"
picsorrules_c45c913f	i	Maybe we should ask everyone if anything significant happened three years ago?	game/hospital.rpy	237	i "[what]"
picsorrules_02592b7b	bi	Three years ago? What was I doing?	game/hospital.rpy	240	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_d87e8c4b	bi	I was twenty, so, that would be the year I-	game/hospital.rpy	241	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_1eaa960b	bi	Got in the driving accident...	game/hospital.rpy	242	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_0c082d4b	bi	I talked to Jenny about this but...	game/hospital.rpy	243	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_d5bfa96e	bi	Am I ready to talk to everyone about it?	game/hospital.rpy	244	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_41ce4f8c	b	Nah, probably not worth it.	game/hospital.rpy	246	b "[what]"
picsorrules_a1bfb07f	b	If anyone has something revealing about them from three years ago, they're just gonna lie about it.	game/hospital.rpy	247	b "[what]"
picsorrules_0e28b61d	bi	Hopefully that stops Sid from pursuing this line of-	game/hospital.rpy	248	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_063e76b0	i	Well, then we can use people's reactions to gauge what's happening!	game/hospital.rpy	249	i "[what]"
picsorrules_b4dc79da	bi	...Or that.	game/hospital.rpy	250	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_7f440984	i	Besides, maybe someone who's not the murderer or Game Master has something to reveal.	game/hospital.rpy	251	i "[what]"
picsorrules_eb9d4032	b	Like what?	game/hospital.rpy	252	b "[what]"
picsorrules_9f377ce3	i	I mean... I dunno, but it can't hurt to ask, right?	game/hospital.rpy	253	i "[what]"
picsorrules_294a11ef	i	Maybe if we find a theme behind what we all did six years ago we can figure out why the composite's missing.	game/hospital.rpy	254	i "[what]"
picsorrules_ecb4ccce	bi	Sid seems really set on this...	game/hospital.rpy	255	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_1ac7bf04	b	Okay, guess we'll discuss this once everyone's here...	game/hospital.rpy	256	b "[what]"
picsorrules_95c7afe9	i	Yeah, I think we should...	game/hospital.rpy	257	i "[what]"
picsorrules_850ef128	b	...	game/hospital.rpy	258	b "[what]"
picsorrules_c1a5984a	b	Okay, well, I guess back to scanning through these.	game/hospital.rpy	259	b "[what]"
picsorrules_78575d7e	i	Uh, yeah.	game/hospital.rpy	260	i "[what]"
picsorrules_14883a0d	bi	...Well, guess I have to talk about it a bit more now...	game/hospital.rpy	262	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_8599be6c	bi	Can I come up with some convincing lie?	game/hospital.rpy	263	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_784523b8	bi	No, I already told them in the train something happened when I was seventeen.	game/hospital.rpy	264	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_ac2f74b9_1	bi	...	game/hospital.rpy	265	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_9f9618f3	bi	I spent some time staring at the photo composites.	game/hospital.rpy	266	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_04e59af5	bi	No familiar names or faces came up.	game/hospital.rpy	267	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_079d73f5	bi	Once I had checked all the photos, it was time to move on.	game/hospital.rpy	268	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_e24d7d31	bi	I went over to the sign, which Dracula was reading.	game/hospital.rpy	272	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_189e09ef	d	Hello Bert.	game/hospital.rpy	276	d "[what]"
picsorrules_23296f1d	b	Hey Dracula. You read the rules already?	game/hospital.rpy	277	b "[what]"
picsorrules_ad401e0d	d	Yes. I thought it might be leftover from when this was place wasn't being used for a killing game.	game/hospital.rpy	278	d "[what]"
picsorrules_40e6c7ce	d	But no, it seems like the rules are for us.	game/hospital.rpy	279	d "[what]"
picsorrules_3a248423	b	What makes you say that?	game/hospital.rpy	280	b "[what]"
picsorrules_8f426dde	d	Read them yourself, then you can arrive at the same conclusion.	game/hospital.rpy	281	d "[what]"
picsorrules_101bdec7	bi	Well, of course I was going to...	game/hospital.rpy	282	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_5666fe90	bi	Seems Dracula doesn't believe in making conversation for the sake of it.	game/hospital.rpy	283	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_3764c113	bi	Alright, let's read these rules...	game/hospital.rpy	284	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_5834098d	blank	Rules of the Latimer Mental Hospital	game/hospital.rpy	286	blank "[what]"
picsorrules_df270d4e	blank	1. This floor has a guard area and a patient area, on the north and south of the cells respectively.	game/hospital.rpy	287	blank "[what]"
picsorrules_b4fd0e28	blank	Every day, two guards will be appointed.	game/hospital.rpy	288	blank "[what]"
picsorrules_7e4827a4	blank	You will know you are a guard if you wake up and the door to the guard's side of this floor is open.	game/hospital.rpy	289	blank "[what]"
picsorrules_daf540eb	blank	Otherwise, the door to the patients' side will be open.	game/hospital.rpy	290	blank "[what]"
picsorrules_351c5a6f	blank	Guards are responsible for the wellbeing of the patients.	game/hospital.rpy	291	blank "[what]"
picsorrules_9e6ff1dc	bi	I see...	game/hospital.rpy	292	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_e8eca7a4	bi	I woke up in my cell, and the south facing door opened for me, so I'm here on the patients' side.	game/hospital.rpy	293	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_d9a0b761	bi	The floor plan must look something like...	game/hospital.rpy	294	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_70e24851	bi	this, with everyone in their room.	game/hospital.rpy	296	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_6b4003be	bi	Creepy.	game/hospital.rpy	297	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_1ed7af2a	bi	Alright, next rule.	game/hospital.rpy	298	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_64b218da	blank	2. Latimer operates on a day-night cycle.	game/hospital.rpy	300	blank "[what]"
picsorrules_55497a64	blank	Every day begins with a 30 minute twilight period, and then a daytime period.	game/hospital.rpy	301	blank "[what]"
picsorrules_9c9bd1d5	blank	Then, another 30 minute twilight period before nighttime.	game/hospital.rpy	302	blank "[what]"
picsorrules_4f170eb5	blank	You may not be {i}in{/i} your cell during the daytime period.	game/hospital.rpy	303	blank "[what]"
picsorrules_0358f1e0	blank	You may not be {i}out of{/i} your cell during the nighttime period.	game/hospital.rpy	304	blank "[what]"
picsorrules_f9c76598	blank	The 30 minute twilight periods should be used to leave your cell in the morning, and return to it at night.	game/hospital.rpy	305	blank "[what]"
picsorrules_79dbdfd2	blank	An intercom will announce when each period begins.	game/hospital.rpy	306	blank "[what]"
picsorrules_72bd7b70	blank	There will be two more announcements when there are 5 minutes of twilight left if someone is in a soon-to-be-forbidden area.	game/hospital.rpy	307	blank "[what]"
picsorrules_8e15bf7f	bi	Hmmm, okay.	game/hospital.rpy	308	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_5bd52569	bi	So this is what the floor looks like during the nighttime.	game/hospital.rpy	310	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_d6a43026	bi	But, once twilight starts in the morning, we have 30 minutes to go to our respective sides.	game/hospital.rpy	311	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_6d1bc804	bi	Which should have two guards on the north side, leaving the other six as patients.	game/hospital.rpy	315	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_95280e55	bi	Then at night, another 30 minute twilight to go back to our rooms, and the cycle repeats with new guards.	game/hospital.rpy	316	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_bf7ad89e	bi	Seems like a scary dynamic for an already terrifying situation...	game/hospital.rpy	317	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_fa339e65	bi	Looks like there's one more rule.	game/hospital.rpy	318	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_6b70c7d9	blank	3. Nobody is permitted to enter the cell of another individual at any time.	game/hospital.rpy	320	blank "[what]"
picsorrules_a307d2e9	blank	If you are in an area you are not allowed to be in at any time, you will be punished.	game/hospital.rpy	321	blank "[what]"
picsorrules_9cd1312b	bi	That rule seems easy enough... don't go into anyone else's cell, and follow rule number two.	game/hospital.rpy	325	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_ac2f74b9_2	bi	...	game/hospital.rpy	329	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_a9c0893f	bi	As if this game wasn't enough of a pain in the ass.	game/hospital.rpy	330	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_24d8feec	bi	Is the Game Master upset we had a party? Wants to keep us in check?	game/hospital.rpy	331	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_5f94607b	b	Interesting.	game/hospital.rpy	332	b "[what]"
picsorrules_fd2b4fc1	b	I'm assuming when this place was a mental hospital, they didn't randomly appoint patients as guards.	game/hospital.rpy	333	b "[what]"
picsorrules_e588cac9	d	I'd say that's a reasonable conclusion.	game/hospital.rpy	334	d "[what]"
picsorrules_bd43e039	bi	...Is that his version of sass?	game/hospital.rpy	335	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_bbb2462f	d	Bert, I have a question for you.	game/hospital.rpy	336	d "[what]"
picsorrules_8c03db59	d	For the Game Master, what do you think is the purpose of these rules?	game/hospital.rpy	337	d "[what]"
picsorrules_df7da4f0	b	I mean... I don't know it seems like some crazed experiment rather than a killing game.	game/hospital.rpy	338	b "[what]"
picsorrules_cb1d6b25	b	I have no idea what this accomplishes towards their overall goals.	game/hospital.rpy	339	b "[what]"
picsorrules_b7f68b77	d	I agree, it's almost like they're emphasizing that we're just lab rats to them.	game/hospital.rpy	340	d "[what]"
picsorrules_2b531993	d	It does make killing someone much harder, however...	game/hospital.rpy	341	d "[what]"
picsorrules_1043e735	b	Huh?	game/hospital.rpy	342	b "[what]"
picsorrules_cf67fe06	d	Think about it. This is presumably part of the area patients have access to.	game/hospital.rpy	343	d "[what]"
picsorrules_990be1fd	d	This room, and the two hallways connecting it to the cells.	game/hospital.rpy	344	d "[what]"
picsorrules_3a038b90	d	Now, if no one stupidly walked off on their own into a hallway...	game/hospital.rpy	345	d "[what]"
picsorrules_93aacade	d	Could you easily commit a murder here?	game/hospital.rpy	346	d "[what]"
picsorrules_7cc9103a	b	Um, I guess not?	game/hospital.rpy	347	b "[what]"
picsorrules_449d5d56	b	There would be a lot of people around to see you do it...	game/hospital.rpy	348	b "[what]"
picsorrules_68d20111	d	Precisely. Both Dan and Stella died in isolation.	game/hospital.rpy	349	d "[what]"
picsorrules_f9efdd07	d	So a murder is going to be hard to commit in this area.	game/hospital.rpy	350	d "[what]"
picsorrules_43e3f2c8	b	Well that just means you have to commit it in the guard area, right?	game/hospital.rpy	351	b "[what]"
picsorrules_3896185b	d	And how do you propose doing that?	game/hospital.rpy	352	d "[what]"
picsorrules_6014868d	b	Um... I mean, if you really had to you could get the other guard to go somewhere out of sight with you.	game/hospital.rpy	353	b "[what]"
picsorrules_c8eefa5e	b	Then just... I guess, stab them or beat them up, whatever's easiest?	game/hospital.rpy	354	b "[what]"
picsorrules_d33255f0	b	I dunno man, I don't really think about how to murder people on a daily basis.	game/hospital.rpy	355	b "[what]"
picsorrules_c8ad44cc	d	Well, suppose you did that.	game/hospital.rpy	356	d "[what]"
picsorrules_b9fbb1c8	bi	Shouldn't he have responded "I don't think about how to murder people on a daily basis either"?	game/hospital.rpy	357	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_a02a862e	d	Say we're guards together. You take me to a corner where no one can see me and kill me.	game/hospital.rpy	358	d "[what]"
picsorrules_4d02e7f7	d	Once the body's found, how do you propose that you would deny being the murderer?	game/hospital.rpy	359	d "[what]"
picsorrules_0bf6f0a5	b	Um... natural causes?	game/hospital.rpy	360	b "[what]"
picsorrules_a92793da	d	Natural causes.	game/hospital.rpy	361	d "[what]"
picsorrules_1e562f74	b	...It was a joke.	game/hospital.rpy	362	b "[what]"
picsorrules_88a70405	d	I don't get it.	game/hospital.rpy	363	d "[what]"
picsorrules_e77cab96	b	...Sigh. Yeah, you're right, it'd be obvious it was me because we were the only two guards.	game/hospital.rpy	364	b "[what]"
picsorrules_a5428016	d	Precisely. So it seems nigh impossible to murder anyone here.	game/hospital.rpy	365	d "[what]"
picsorrules_9ff16cac	b	But... a murder has to happen for the game to progress, right?	game/hospital.rpy	366	b "[what]"
picsorrules_801d0720	d	Well, we don't know that.	game/hospital.rpy	367	d "[what]"
picsorrules_6b74bc5a	d	What happens if no murder occurs for days on end?	game/hospital.rpy	368	d "[what]"
picsorrules_a4b622c1	d	Perhaps the Game Master just leaves us to starve to death.	game/hospital.rpy	369	d "[what]"
picsorrules_621f3861	d	Perhaps they'll replenish our food supply, but make us decide if not murdering is worth being stuck forever.	game/hospital.rpy	370	d "[what]"
picsorrules_45e21978	b	Well, I hope it doesn't come to that...	game/hospital.rpy	371	b "[what]"
picsorrules_35cb461d	d	So you wish that someone dies?	game/hospital.rpy	372	d "[what]"
picsorrules_c39bb92f	b	What? No!	game/hospital.rpy	373	b "[what]"
picsorrules_91b94bf3	b	Well, I mean... I guess yeah, I'd prefer the Game Master dying to us being stuck here.	game/hospital.rpy	374	b "[what]"
picsorrules_15caa943	d	But that is statistically unlikely. The murderer has a one out of seven chance.	game/hospital.rpy	375	d "[what]"
picsorrules_397693a2	b	One out of seven? They can make an educated guess, right?	game/hospital.rpy	376	b "[what]"
picsorrules_e1b65f93	b	For example, there's no way Freddy's the Game Master.	game/hospital.rpy	377	b "[what]"
picsorrules_ef93de01	d	Oh Bert, so optimistically naive...	game/hospital.rpy	378	d "[what]"
picsorrules_3838063e	d	Regardless, I actually doubt it will get to that point.	game/hospital.rpy	379	d "[what]"
picsorrules_12d91c9b	b	Didn't you just try to argue that murdering someone and getting away with it would be impossible?	game/hospital.rpy	380	b "[what]"
picsorrules_b23c18ed	d	I said much harder. Not impossible.	game/hospital.rpy	381	d "[what]"
picsorrules_a1e90977	d	For example, you could poison someone's food as a guard.	game/hospital.rpy	382	d "[what]"
picsorrules_23481abd	d	That would at least give you a fifty-fifty chance of your guard partner being accused in your place.	game/hospital.rpy	383	d "[what]"
picsorrules_529f3654	d	Better yet, if the poison takes a few days to act...	game/hospital.rpy	384	d "[what]"
picsorrules_816717e2	d	Then other guards will come and go before someone dies.	game/hospital.rpy	385	d "[what]"
picsorrules_a8c9e8bd	d	Then you'd have a really good alibi.	game/hospital.rpy	386	d "[what]"
picsorrules_530c69c3	b	But that requires poison to pull off...	game/hospital.rpy	387	b "[what]"
picsorrules_17d9fa2d	d	I'm just saying, the avenue of murder will have to be a somewhat contrived one to be successful.	game/hospital.rpy	388	d "[what]"
picsorrules_2e7aafe5	bi	Like tricking someone into completing part of a circuit attached to a generator isn't contrived enough...	game/hospital.rpy	389	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_eb8f1f2f	b	Why are you telling me all this?	game/hospital.rpy	390	b "[what]"
picsorrules_4200aad9	d	Having someone to hear my theories makes it more obvious if they have errors.	game/hospital.rpy	391	d "[what]"
picsorrules_021c1e52	b	Isn't Sam the person you'd normally talk to about this?	game/hospital.rpy	392	b "[what]"
picsorrules_75b1798c	d	I have a feeling Sam's prefrontal cortex out of commission for a while.	game/hospital.rpy	393	d "[what]"
picsorrules_089a6167	b	Prefrontal cortex?	game/hospital.rpy	394	b "[what]"
picsorrules_e6f6a6d1	d	The part of the brain that does critical thinking.	game/hospital.rpy	395	d "[what]"
picsorrules_41d719a5	b	So... I'm Sam's replacement.	game/hospital.rpy	396	b "[what]"
picsorrules_9858b122	d	I guess so, yes.	game/hospital.rpy	397	d "[what]"
picsorrules_850ef128_1	b	...	game/hospital.rpy	398	b "[what]"
picsorrules_16e656c1	b	Okay, well, bye Dracula.	game/hospital.rpy	399	b "[what]"
picsorrules_5286fe67	bi	Well, I guess that's everything to see in this room.	game/hospital.rpy	402	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_ca7080ce	bi	Unless I want to stare at some really boring tables.	game/hospital.rpy	403	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_61507503	bi	In the meantime, it seemed everyone had filtered into the cafeteria.	game/hospital.rpy	404	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_511dc6f4	j	Hey Bert! Seems like we're in a hospital now!	game/hospital.rpy	407	j "[what]"
picsorrules_3bfe41ad	bi	That's... not really something to be cheery about.	game/hospital.rpy	408	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_f0c2f53e	b	Hey Jenny. How's it going?	game/hospital.rpy	409	b "[what]"
picsorrules_6e593667	j	Oh, I'm doing as good as I can be!	game/hospital.rpy	410	j "[what]"
picsorrules_58189e12	j	But doesn't seem like everyone else is.	game/hospital.rpy	412	j "[what]"
picsorrules_1043e735_1	b	Huh?	game/hospital.rpy	413	b "[what]"
picsorrules_096f7947	j	Well, Sam is pretty torn up about trying to kill Stella.	game/hospital.rpy	414	j "[what]"
picsorrules_9f2923d9	j	And Shahar says he's been having a headache since we got here.	game/hospital.rpy	415	j "[what]"
picsorrules_a777b34c	j	You mind talking to Shahar?	game/hospital.rpy	416	j "[what]"
picsorrules_f5933314	b	Huh? Why me...	game/hospital.rpy	417	b "[what]"
picsorrules_034ea676	j	Well, you did spend a lot of time with him in the mansion, like it or not.	game/hospital.rpy	418	j "[what]"
picsorrules_a941169f	j	And I think we need to keep everyone... well, as happy as they can be, you know.	game/hospital.rpy	419	j "[what]"
picsorrules_c7e51041	j	Not just for their sake.	game/hospital.rpy	420	j "[what]"
picsorrules_d2821e1d	j	If we have people too sad to think or help out, well...	game/hospital.rpy	421	j "[what]"
picsorrules_fbc47cf1	j	It's going to be harder solve a murder mystery with less brainpower.	game/hospital.rpy	422	j "[what]"
picsorrules_50b6b0af	j	Or even just find out more about why we're here and who the Game Master is.	game/hospital.rpy	423	j "[what]"
picsorrules_78f9fe5a	bi	I don't know if I'd classify Shahar's contributions as "brainpower" but...	game/hospital.rpy	424	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_00fe0ddd	b	That's true... yeah, I can talk to Shahar.	game/hospital.rpy	425	b "[what]"
picsorrules_b0f8f014	j	Great! So you'll talk to both Shahar and Sam!	game/hospital.rpy	427	j "[what]"
picsorrules_ca2b54f7	b	Wha-	game/hospital.rpy	428	b "[what]"
picsorrules_69d726d6	j	Thanks Bert, that's really nice of you!	game/hospital.rpy	429	j "[what]"
picsorrules_e70039db	bi	She left before I could even respond...	game/hospital.rpy	431	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_ebd044bc	bi	I'm not the best at cheering people up, why can't someone like Lauren do this?	game/hospital.rpy	432	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_7733b13d	bi	Sigh. Okay, might as well bite the bullet.	game/hospital.rpy	433	bi "[what]"
picsorrules_c218775c	bi	Let's see, Shahar or Sam...	game/hospital.rpy	434	bi "[what]"
samorshahar_b27f2bd0	s	Oh... hey Bert.	game/hospital.rpy	442	s "[what]"
samorshahar_fe4221a3	b	Hey Sam... how are you feeling?	game/hospital.rpy	443	b "[what]"
samorshahar_edac5ee4	s	I don't know, I just tried to kill someone because I thought I had to.	game/hospital.rpy	444	s "[what]"
samorshahar_f148810f	s	But then I found out I didn't have to, I'm just an idiot.	game/hospital.rpy	445	s "[what]"
samorshahar_b42dba5b	s	So now I'm someone who murdered without a good reason.	game/hospital.rpy	446	s "[what]"
samorshahar_f0c269db	s	So what do you think, that I'm feeling fine?	game/hospital.rpy	447	s "[what]"
samorshahar_87f49a9f	bi	Still sassy, even when feeling sad...	game/hospital.rpy	448	bi "[what]"
samorshahar_0603440d	bi	But I guess it was a dumb question.	game/hospital.rpy	449	bi "[what]"
samorshahar_7f421c05	b	Sam... you didn't kill Stella. Catherine did.	game/hospital.rpy	450	b "[what]"
samorshahar_7fe236b8	s	I may as well have.	game/hospital.rpy	451	s "[what]"
samorshahar_ac5db2a5	s	Catherine got lucky that I pushed Stella into her trap.	game/hospital.rpy	452	s "[what]"
samorshahar_2a4a72ee	s	If Stella's standing one foot to the right when I stab her...	game/hospital.rpy	453	s "[what]"
samorshahar_ce1e2096	s	I'm the one who killed her, and Catherine has nothing to do with it.	game/hospital.rpy	454	s "[what]"
samorshahar_ecd65921	s	Murder isn't a card game Bert.	game/hospital.rpy	455	s "[what]"
samorshahar_33222e76	s	You don't avoid murdering someone on a technicality.	game/hospital.rpy	456	s "[what]"
samorshahar_479fa59b	s	Even if I make it out of this hellhole, I'm a murderer for the rest of my life.	game/hospital.rpy	457	s "[what]"
samorshahar_9c47efe5	s	My mother and father will celebrate holidays with a murderer.	game/hospital.rpy	458	s "[what]"
samorshahar_a22eabad	s	If I want to have kids, they'll be raised by a murderer.	game/hospital.rpy	459	s "[what]"
samorshahar_e27bbbec	b	You didn't know.	game/hospital.rpy	460	b "[what]"
samorshahar_93099047	b	If you were the designated murderer and Stella was the mastermind, you'd have saved our lives.	game/hospital.rpy	461	b "[what]"
samorshahar_55dc102d	s	Bert, have you ever murdered someone?	game/hospital.rpy	462	s "[what]"
samorshahar_d5809fe4	b	I mean-	game/hospital.rpy	463	b "[what]"
samorshahar_a6451eb9	s	{i}Willingly{/i} murdered someone?	game/hospital.rpy	464	s "[what]"
samorshahar_5854db22	b	...No.	game/hospital.rpy	465	b "[what]"

samorshahar_676aff42	b	Uh...	game/hospital.rpy	574	b "[what]"
samorshahar_2033a730	f	You know, when you have to go sit in the corner and face the wall.	game/hospital.rpy	575	f "[what]"
samorshahar_c319d15e	f	And you can't even play video games or listen to music.	game/hospital.rpy	576	f "[what]"

samorshahar_69ae5ec6	l	That's... one kind of punishment, yeah Freddy.	game/hospital.rpy	585	l "[what]"
samorshahar_8a7aa56f	l	But I think what the sign means is something worse than that.	game/hospital.rpy	586	l "[what]"
samorshahar_aff1cc82	f	Worse than time out? That's not possible!	game/hospital.rpy	587	f "[what]"
samorshahar_2015cd97	f	What could be worse than time out?	game/hospital.rpy	588	f "[what]"

samorshahar_da7847f1	i	Oh yeah, I had something I wanted to discuss.	game/hospital.rpy	594	i "[what]"
samorshahar_5a729366	i	There's photos of all the people who got discharged from this hospital in the past.	game/hospital.rpy	595	i "[what]"
samorshahar_47e71198	i	They have one photo composite per year, but the one from three years ago is missing.	game/hospital.rpy	596	i "[what]"
samorshahar_d196c6de	i	Is it possible someone important was on that composite?	game/hospital.rpy	597	i "[what]"
samorshahar_2e71a8de	l	Like one of us?	game/hospital.rpy	598	l "[what]"
samorshahar_55c3d4e7	i	Maybe. But it could also be someone related to one of us?	game/hospital.rpy	599	i "[what]"
samorshahar_f49bc5dd	i	Or maybe that was an important year for why this game happened.	game/hospital.rpy	600	i "[what]"
samorshahar_90a21e29	b	Important year?	game/hospital.rpy	601	b "[what]"
samorshahar_4d3c7201	i	Yeah, after Bert and I talked about the photos I was thinking...	game/hospital.rpy	602	i "[what]"
samorshahar_fb1080d8	i	I haven't really done anything that bad in the past three years.	game/hospital.rpy	603	i "[what]"
samorshahar_c0a35466	i	If I was chosen to be a part of this game, it has to be for something that happened before that, right?	game/hospital.rpy	604	i "[what]"
samorshahar_c2b90565	i	I was wondering...	game/hospital.rpy	605	i "[what]"
samorshahar_6fb6b2d1	i	Did any of your crimes happen in the past three years?	game/hospital.rpy	606	i "[what]"
samorshahar_784264f9	i	You don't have to say what your crimes were, I know some of you can't really talk about it.	game/hospital.rpy	607	i "[what]"
samorshahar_a9398acf	i	But just that one bit of info might reveal a whole lot.	game/hospital.rpy	608	i "[what]"
samorshahar_d0752942	bi	Thank you, Sid...	game/hospital.rpy	609	bi "[what]"

samorshahar_5c1dea4c	bi	No one remembered committing a crime in the past three years...	game/hospital.rpy	612	bi "[what]"
samorshahar_2c5b15d8	bi	Except for one person.	game/hospital.rpy	618	bi "[what]"
samorshahar_35ab7ede	s	I guess... I've been committing crimes perpetually...	game/hospital.rpy	619	s "[what]"
samorshahar_a0baf7a4	s	Not like I ever stopped dealing drugs...	game/hospital.rpy	620	s "[what]"
samorshahar_0a118b3a	l	Well... when did you deal drugs to Mr. Sydell?	game/hospital.rpy	621	l "[what]"
samorshahar_64f37107	bi	Right, Sam mentioned that in the mansion.	game/hospital.rpy	622	bi "[what]"
samorshahar_3d9cea60	s	...I lost contact with him about three years ago...	game/hospital.rpy	623	s "[what]"
samorshahar_f602bd6e	b	Lost contact?	game/hospital.rpy	624	b "[what]"
samorshahar_2ccee3f0	s	He just never reached out to me again...	game/hospital.rpy	625	s "[what]"
samorshahar_f5386738	s	And well, not like I personally knew the guy...	game/hospital.rpy	626	s "[what]"
samorshahar_b3d742d0	s	I had no reason to reach out to him...	game/hospital.rpy	627	s "[what]"
samorshahar_03754ae8	b	I wonder... did something happen to him three years ago?	game/hospital.rpy	628	b "[what]"
samorshahar_8a0dc13c	l	Maybe he disappeared to start planning this game?	game/hospital.rpy	629	l "[what]"
samorshahar_d63dcc86	i	I thought the Game Master was one of us?	game/hospital.rpy	630	i "[what]"
samorshahar_2ea253ee	i	None of us look like him...	game/hospital.rpy	631	i "[what]"
samorshahar_950ed26a	i	But I think you're right Bert.	game/hospital.rpy	632	i "[what]"
samorshahar_0a9ae428	i	There's no way what Sam said isn't related to the missing photo composite.	game/hospital.rpy	633	i "[what]"
samorshahar_6034102d	i	Maybe Mr. Sydell was on it.	game/hospital.rpy	634	i "[what]"
samorshahar_521c5718	i	Maybe whatever happened to him three years ago is the reason for this game!	game/hospital.rpy	635	i "[what]"

samorshahar_448388e7	ses	Mew!	game/hospital.rpy	708	ses "[what]"
samorshahar_c288edcc	bi	Sesame was standing near the opposite door.	game/hospital.rpy	710	bi "[what]"
samorshahar_d6c194eb	bi	Right, maybe I'm one of the guards today.	game/hospital.rpy	711	bi "[what]"
samorshahar_2bdb6412	b	Thanks Sesame.	game/hospital.rpy	712	b "[what]"
samorshahar_af7aa038	bi	I stepped outside into the hallway.	game/hospital.rpy	714	bi "[what]"
samorshahar_fd811f48	bi	Guess it's time to explore.	game/hospital.rpy	715	bi "[what]"
samorshahar_c38a90d4	j	Oh, hey Bert! Hey Sesame!	game/hospital.rpy	720	j "[what]"
samorshahar_7b7db7a8	j	Guess we're on guard duty today!	game/hospital.rpy	721	j "[what]"
samorshahar_11b834d3	b	Oh, nice. I was kind of afraid I'd be paired with someone like Dracula...	game/hospital.rpy	722	b "[what]"
samorshahar_369a8520	j	Ha! Nope, just little old me.	game/hospital.rpy	723	j "[what]"
samorshahar_898ffc9c	j	Don't get on my bad side though, or I'll have to make up stories about being a vampire to scare you away!	game/hospital.rpy	724	j "[what]"
samorshahar_57428172	b	Please don't.	game/hospital.rpy	725	b "[what]"
samorshahar_2d6b550e	j	Don't worry, I wouldn't even know how.	game/hospital.rpy	726	j "[what]"
samorshahar_be3d61b6	j	So, whaddya wanna do first?	game/hospital.rpy	727	j "[what]"
samorshahar_1c8acc22	b	I think we have to make food for the others, but twilight isn't even over yet.	game/hospital.rpy	728	b "[what]"
samorshahar_8905f885	b	So I was thinking we should explore and tell the others what we find.	game/hospital.rpy	729	b "[what]"
samorshahar_2d911d5f	j	Sounds like a plan!	game/hospital.rpy	730	j "[what]"
samorshahar_a7b71c10	b	Okay, let's see what's at the end of this hallway...	game/hospital.rpy	731	b "[what]"
samorshahar_182a6930	j	Huh, what's this?	game/hospital.rpy	739	j "[what]"
samorshahar_acb28eb5	b	It looks like it's a common area for the guards.	game/hospital.rpy	740	b "[what]"
samorshahar_5f440a96	j	It's... so much nicer than the common area for the patients.	game/hospital.rpy	741	j "[what]"
samorshahar_7579fa30	j	A nice lighting fixture, a vending machine, some couches...	game/hospital.rpy	742	j "[what]"
samorshahar_ffe990d9	j	What looks like a window, except it's been boarded up...	game/hospital.rpy	743	j "[what]"
samorshahar_6a3cad34	b	I guess we can relax here after we've fed everyone if we want to.	game/hospital.rpy	744	b "[what]"
samorshahar_3832d62b	b	This kind of reminds me of that study on prisoners and guards though.	game/hospital.rpy	745	b "[what]"
samorshahar_5955e8c1	b	Is the Game Master trying to get us to feel like we're better than them?	game/hospital.rpy	746	b "[what]"
samorshahar_9e693d20	j	Oh that? I'm pretty sure the study was just egged on by the professor in charge.	game/hospital.rpy	747	j "[what]"
samorshahar_71e20449	j	Crazy guy who more concerned with producing some publishable results than with being humane.	game/hospital.rpy	748	j "[what]"
samorshahar_c66e6609	j	Besides, we'll only be on this side for one day.	game/hospital.rpy	749	j "[what]"
samorshahar_ce705776	j	Now c'mon, let's look around the room.	game/hospital.rpy	750	j "[what]"
samorshahar_326ab9e3	j	We should probably start with these rules...	game/hospital.rpy	751	j "[what]"
samorshahar_7dfee4d2	b	Oh god, is there stuff that can get us killed on this side too?	game/hospital.rpy	752	b "[what]"
samorshahar_b4fa3fc0	j	...	game/hospital.rpy	753	j "[what]"
samorshahar_d25d791d	j	Hm, no, it's just a repeat of the rules on the other side.	game/hospital.rpy	754	j "[what]"
samorshahar_7694068e	j	I guess we can't go into the common space for patients.	game/hospital.rpy	755	j "[what]"
samorshahar_a90f8b93	j	So it makes sense to give us a copy to read in here.	game/hospital.rpy	756	j "[what]"
samorshahar_fffe0587	b	Psh, reading's boring, I'm tryna check out this vending machine.	game/hospital.rpy	757	b "[what]"
samorshahar_5d7c8c3b	b	Maybe there's some cola in there...	game/hospital.rpy	758	b "[what]"
samorshahar_df011ca7	b	I like a good classic cola, nothing beats that.	game/hospital.rpy	759	b "[what]"
samorshahar_b2f9a690	b	Huh, this vending machine's very... old-timey.	game/hospital.rpy	760	b "[what]"
samorshahar_590c39ef	j	What makes you say that?	game/hospital.rpy	761	j "[what]"
samorshahar_0d51b880	b	All the bottles are glass. It reminds me of how they package soda in foreign countries.	game/hospital.rpy	762	b "[what]"
samorshahar_5262d0ba	b	But I don't think I've seen a vending machine with glass bottles where I'm from.	game/hospital.rpy	763	b "[what]"
samorshahar_88dad62c	j	Hm... I wonder how long ago this building was in use.	game/hospital.rpy	764	j "[what]"
samorshahar_d06b0084	j	Or maybe they just didn't have money to upgrade it?	game/hospital.rpy	765	j "[what]"
samorshahar_45ee38ae	j	Ooh, maybe the Game Master bought this place because they went bankrupt!	game/hospital.rpy	766	j "[what]"
samorshahar_2f6a7d7b	b	That's... a theory, not sure if we can infer from that, though.	game/hospital.rpy	767	b "[what]"
samorshahar_d906d8e3	b	Besides "The Game Master has money or influence."	game/hospital.rpy	768	b "[what]"
samorshahar_3f21110b	j	Hey, that's something!	game/hospital.rpy	770	j "[what]"
samorshahar_d49049ea	bi	I... could've guessed that without seeing this vending machine.	game/hospital.rpy	771	bi "[what]"
samorshahar_ada9d2c5	b	Well, there is cola in here, I'm gonna grab some!	game/hospital.rpy	772	b "[what]"
samorshahar_5c96dc85	b	At least, I think it's cola. None of the bottles are labelled.	game/hospital.rpy	773	b "[what]"
samorshahar_c48c24b5	b	For all I know it could be root beer, which is gross...	game/hospital.rpy	774	b "[what]"
samorshahar_8ac99488	b	Huh? It's not vending...	game/hospital.rpy	776	b "[what]"
samorshahar_2c393de2	j	Did you pay for the drink?	game/hospital.rpy	778	j "[what]"
samorshahar_3fc291ff	b	Pay? With what? Not like we have money here...	game/hospital.rpy	779	b "[what]"
samorshahar_ab9074e4	j	You could break the vending machine open if you really want to.	game/hospital.rpy	780	j "[what]"
samorshahar_3fcc2afe	b	That sounds dangerous...	game/hospital.rpy	781	b "[what]"
samorshahar_507056cc	b	Don't people die getting crushed by vending machines?	game/hospital.rpy	782	b "[what]"
samorshahar_df99c4f0	j	That's just a risk you'll have to take.	game/hospital.rpy	783	j "[what]"
samorshahar_850ef128_1	b	...	game/hospital.rpy	784	b "[what]"
samorshahar_68e25880	j	If you get injured, you can use the first aid kit on the wall.	game/hospital.rpy	785	j "[what]"
samorshahar_4413915c	b	Oh, we should probably check that out, huh...	game/hospital.rpy	786	b "[what]"
samorshahar_acf2407d	j	Yeah, if someone else dies we can patch up their wounds with it!	game/hospital.rpy	787	j "[what]"
samorshahar_c4a3020b	b	Well... that wasn't what I had in mind.	game/hospital.rpy	788	b "[what]"
samorshahar_a8ac71c1	b	Just like, we should see if there's poison in here or anything.	game/hospital.rpy	789	b "[what]"
samorshahar_511fd5f2	b	If there's a way to poison someone's food like Dracula said, it's probably in here.	game/hospital.rpy	790	b "[what]"
samorshahar_a01de6c6	j	Oh. Yeah, I guess that makes sense.	game/hospital.rpy	791	j "[what]"
samorshahar_d32e2e96	b	Okay, what do we have here...	game/hospital.rpy	792	b "[what]"
samorshahar_1d23baf0	b	Some band-aids, gauze, pills for treating things like headaches.	game/hospital.rpy	793	b "[what]"
samorshahar_4a21bd40	b	A thermometer, gloves, tweezers...	game/hospital.rpy	794	b "[what]"
samorshahar_6e3dcb08	b	...Huh, what's medical glue? There's a container of it here.	game/hospital.rpy	795	b "[what]"
samorshahar_eccf31a8	j	Never heard of it.	game/hospital.rpy	796	j "[what]"
samorshahar_0c05beed	b	The first aid kit seems kinda old, maybe it's not used much anymore?	game/hospital.rpy	797	b "[what]"
samorshahar_c7231eb3	j	Shouldn't a hospital be keeping its first aid kit up to date?	game/hospital.rpy	798	j "[what]"
samorshahar_adc66e75	b	Yeah, but a hospital also probably shouldn't be used for a killing game...	game/hospital.rpy	799	b "[what]"
samorshahar_29321267	b	Anyway, doesn't seem like there's much else in here?	game/hospital.rpy	800	b "[what]"
samorshahar_7918b288	b	Just some couches we could maybe take a nap on...	game/hospital.rpy	801	b "[what]"
samorshahar_9463905b	j	What, did you want to play video games or something in here?	game/hospital.rpy	802	j "[what]"
samorshahar_6bd0fe46	b	I mean... I wouldn't say no...	game/hospital.rpy	803	b "[what]"
samorshahar_2e4728ff	j	You're so silly.	game/hospital.rpy	805	j "[what]"
samorshahar_d25d6df9	intercom	There are 5 minutes left in twilight. You must leave your room before twilight is over.	game/hospital.rpy	807	intercom "[what]"
samorshahar_dbecedae	j	Hm, seems like someone hasn't left their room yet.	game/hospital.rpy	809	j "[what]"
samorshahar_4dcc46dc	b	How do you know that?	game/hospital.rpy	810	b "[what]"
samorshahar_d4b35efa	j	The rules said we'd only hear the 5 minute announcement if someone was still in their room.	game/hospital.rpy	811	j "[what]"
samorshahar_1dd145c7	b	Oh, that's true.	game/hospital.rpy	812	b "[what]"
samorshahar_2d3b5384	b	I wonder who it is...	game/hospital.rpy	813	b "[what]"
samorshahar_d72bb99a	j	Oh, that probably means we should get working on food.	game/hospital.rpy	814	j "[what]"
samorshahar_18b94dbc	j	We didn't eat anything yesterday, people are probably starving.	game/hospital.rpy	815	j "[what]"
samorshahar_d2e9653c	blank	Brooorgh.	game/hospital.rpy	816	blank "[what]"
samorshahar_9c03c4ee	j	What was that?	game/hospital.rpy	817	j "[what]"
samorshahar_ada9185b	b	That... might have been my stomach.	game/hospital.rpy	818	b "[what]"
samorshahar_d0cc8f1b	j	Case in point. I'm going to go to the kitchen, you should feel free to keep exploring.	game/hospital.rpy	819	j "[what]"
samorshahar_9919d885	j	That way we make the most use of our time.	game/hospital.rpy	820	j "[what]"
samorshahar_105cec35	b	If you say so...	game/hospital.rpy	821	b "[what]"
samorshahar_eb405252	j	No worries Bert, I cooked for us once, I don't mind doing it again.	game/hospital.rpy	823	j "[what]"
samorshahar_272137c6	j	I think this door is to the kitchen, you should get out the other two doors in here.	game/hospital.rpy	824	j "[what]"
samorshahar_539fe74f	b	Sounds good. Thanks Jenny, I'll let you know what I find.	game/hospital.rpy	825	b "[what]"
samorshahar_10e34c62	bi	Alright, let's see what's behind door number one...	game/hospital.rpy	827	bi "[what]"
samorshahar_850ef128_2	b	...	game/hospital.rpy	831	b "[what]"
samorshahar_9664a718	b	What is this?	game/hospital.rpy	832	b "[what]"
samorshahar_b2750d87	b	A computer system? This gives me bad flashbacks to the train...	game/hospital.rpy	833	b "[what]"
samorshahar_2601d1a2	bi	I don't know why I talked out loud when it was just me and Sesame.	game/hospital.rpy	834	bi "[what]"
samorshahar_2c757a65	bi	Not like he could understand...	game/hospital.rpy	835	bi "[what]"
samorshahar_a490da19	b	Let's try turning it on...	game/hospital.rpy	836	b "[what]"
samorshahar_1eef5678	b	Hm, there isn't a login screen like on the train.	game/hospital.rpy	837	b "[what]"
samorshahar_4b549754	b	Let's see, what's interesting...	game/hospital.rpy	838	b "[what]"
samorshahar_d7ef1a6c	b	Seems like there's a program they use to store patient information.	game/hospital.rpy	839	b "[what]"
samorshahar_c6b2c94d	b	Kind of like that program dentists use that stores your history, but it's... well, for a mental hospital.	game/hospital.rpy	840	b "[what]"
samorshahar_b76e2a10	b	Then there's a security camera system.	game/hospital.rpy	841	b "[what]"
samorshahar_850ef128_3	b	...	game/hospital.rpy	842	b "[what]"
samorshahar_029ed1a8	b	Yup, I can see the cafeteria from here.	game/hospital.rpy	843	b "[what]"
samorshahar_44e615ab	b	Everyone had gathered, Jenny was talking to Sid through the kitchen window.	game/hospital.rpy	844	b "[what]"
samorshahar_7ddc9bf5	b	Hmm, it has an option to look at other rooms, but the button's not working.	game/hospital.rpy	845	b "[what]"
samorshahar_3a56b496	b	It'd be impossible to commit a murder if a guard was just looping through the cameras.	game/hospital.rpy	846	b "[what]"
samorshahar_29af0f8e	b	The cafeteria is a hard place to pull off a murder, so it's not really too useful to have a camera there.	game/hospital.rpy	847	b "[what]"
samorshahar_bd6b5b1f	b	The Game Master keeping things fair, I guess...	game/hospital.rpy	848	b "[what]"
samorshahar_e2e4395c	b	There's also a program that controls the utilities in the building.	game/hospital.rpy	849	b "[what]"
samorshahar_86804615	b	You can turn off the lights, there's something about cycling hot water through the plumbing system...	game/hospital.rpy	850	b "[what]"
samorshahar_775a9931	b	Change the temperature throughout the building...	game/hospital.rpy	851	b "[what]"
samorshahar_f32d8ee4	b	Doesn't seem like there's any way to control the cell doors, the nighttime announcement, or anything useful though.	game/hospital.rpy	852	b "[what]"
samorshahar_a6a8f00e	b	It would be nice if we could roam freely...	game/hospital.rpy	853	b "[what]"
samorshahar_2fe02643	b	Right now it's just me and Jenny...	game/hospital.rpy	854	b "[what]"
samorshahar_850ef128_4	b	...	game/hospital.rpy	855	b "[what]"
samorshahar_1d3e85ba	b	She wouldn't kill me now, right?	game/hospital.rpy	856	b "[what]"
samorshahar_804f208d	b	Should I look out for her?	game/hospital.rpy	857	b "[what]"
samorshahar_27190818	b	Anyone could be the murderer, including her...	game/hospital.rpy	858	b "[what]"
samorshahar_66b78839	b	No, I need to stop freaking out.	game/hospital.rpy	859	b "[what]"
samorshahar_0d0f9530	b	If she killed me here it would be way too obvious.	game/hospital.rpy	860	b "[what]"
samorshahar_6bce876c	b	Plus, it's not like I can do anything about it, I'm stuck on this side with her.	game/hospital.rpy	861	b "[what]"
samorshahar_7a92b29f	b	I should focus on being as useful as possible while I'm able to explore this side...	game/hospital.rpy	862	b "[what]"
samorshahar_c4e5e304	b	Speaking of which, time to move on.	game/hospital.rpy	863	b "[what]"
samorshahar_448388e7_1	ses	Mew!	game/hospital.rpy	864	ses "[what]"
samorshahar_c9327ca2	bi	Sesame jumped on the controls and then jumped off...	game/hospital.rpy	867	bi "[what]"
samorshahar_32069ab5	b	Huh? This is the program storing patient information.	game/hospital.rpy	868	b "[what]"
samorshahar_af7978bf	b	I guess I should take a look, maybe there's something useful here?	game/hospital.rpy	869	b "[what]"
samorshahar_c13a48a1	b	Maybe I should look for the name Sydell, see if he has a connection to this place too.	game/hospital.rpy	870	b "[what]"
samorshahar_850ef128_5	b	...	game/hospital.rpy	871	b "[what]"
samorshahar_8cd09c04	b	No, it's just a bunch of names I don't recognize.	game/hospital.rpy	872	b "[what]"
samorshahar_92f436dc	b	This feels invasive... it's a lot of personal information about people I don't know.	game/hospital.rpy	873	b "[what]"
samorshahar_a5a5024c	b	It'd be like looking at strangers' search histories, except it's their mental illnesses.	game/hospital.rpy	874	b "[what]"
samorshahar_850ef128_6	b	...	game/hospital.rpy	875	b "[what]"
samorshahar_1043e735	b	Huh?	game/hospital.rpy	877	b "[what]"
samorshahar_5e116723	b	Why is Shahar's name in the patient records?	game/hospital.rpy	878	b "[what]"
samorshahar_3779a6d3	b	I had to scroll a few hundred lines to find his name. I almost missed it.	game/hospital.rpy	879	b "[what]"
samorshahar_adae42d2	b	Let me check the record...	game/hospital.rpy	880	b "[what]"
samorshahar_850ef128_7	b	...	game/hospital.rpy	881	b "[what]"
samorshahar_395a0045	b	His record is almost completely blank.	game/hospital.rpy	882	b "[what]"
samorshahar_100075da	b	All it says is "Patient thinks he is a pirate."	game/hospital.rpy	883	b "[what]"
samorshahar_1f2e7a08	b	Nothing about who Shahar actually is, any contact information...	game/hospital.rpy	884	b "[what]"
samorshahar_12bbfc50	b	Is that the case for the other records?	game/hospital.rpy	885	b "[what]"
samorshahar_7ef06eff	b	Let me check one.	game/hospital.rpy	886	b "[what]"
samorshahar_77e4f763	b	Whoever Howard Eastnuts is, I'm sorry for looking...	game/hospital.rpy	888	b "[what]"
samorshahar_850ef128_8	b	...	game/hospital.rpy	889	b "[what]"
samorshahar_0321c2c8	b	This person has family contact information, a detailed medical history...	game/hospital.rpy	890	b "[what]"
samorshahar_1ad0f117	b	Date of admission, date of discharge, insurance information, prescriptions.	game/hospital.rpy	891	b "[what]"
samorshahar_25691407	b	And a bunch more details Shahar's profile here lacks.	game/hospital.rpy	892	b "[what]"
samorshahar_a6acbb8a	b	Was Shahar's profile inserted to freak me out? Was he actually a patient here?	game/hospital.rpy	894	b "[what]"
samorshahar_411cbbd6	b	Did someone wipe his information before we got here? Maybe the Game Master thought we'd learn too much?	game/hospital.rpy	895	b "[what]"
samorshahar_c954e8b3	b	Maybe Shahar is the Game Master and he's using this as a bluff?	game/hospital.rpy	896	b "[what]"
samorshahar_37678256	b	I should check one more thing, just to be sure...	game/hospital.rpy	897	b "[what]"
samorshahar_850ef128_9	b	...	game/hospital.rpy	898	b "[what]"
samorshahar_ef2efa2a	b	Nope, I've tried all of our names. Including Kaiser, Dan, Catherine, and Stella's.	game/hospital.rpy	899	b "[what]"
samorshahar_a28ba362	b	No one in this game except Shahar has a record here.	game/hospital.rpy	900	b "[what]"
samorshahar_fe716afe	b	I should talk to Shahar about this.	game/hospital.rpy	901	b "[what]"
samorshahar_b6ea44e9	b	This might have to do with his headache.	game/hospital.rpy	902	b "[what]"
samorshahar_5a6d0bb3	b	Well, assuming he's not lying...	game/hospital.rpy	903	b "[what]"
samorshahar_5fc8edeb	b	Should I tell the others though?	game/hospital.rpy	904	b "[what]"
samorshahar_daa47b14	b	On the one hand, if I'm withholding information that makes me look bad.	game/hospital.rpy	905	b "[what]"
samorshahar_bde1424c	b	If this ties Shahar to the location, based on the past two locations doesn't that make him more likely to be the murderer?	game/hospital.rpy	906	b "[what]"
samorshahar_854770c0	b	On the other hand, this is Shahar's personal life.	game/hospital.rpy	907	b "[what]"
samorshahar_511ac67c	b	I guess it's not really news to anyone that this whole pirate thing is a bit crazy but...	game/hospital.rpy	908	b "[what]"
samorshahar_10f6c983	b	If it's a red herring it could be problematic.	game/hospital.rpy	909	b "[what]"
samorshahar_50ffef2d	b	Plus, with this few people remaining, it's hard to trust anyone.	game/hospital.rpy	910	b "[what]"
samorshahar_850ef128_10	b	...	game/hospital.rpy	911	b "[what]"
samorshahar_768beaa6	b	I don't think I'll tell anyone except Shahar.	game/hospital.rpy	912	b "[what]"
samorshahar_4ff0092b	b	I feel sorry for Shahar... I don't want to give people reason to gang up their suspicions on him.	game/hospital.rpy	913	b "[what]"
samorshahar_3fe64881	b	There's no way the Game Master would make it this obvious who they are.	game/hospital.rpy	914	b "[what]"
samorshahar_b2de4ca3	b	So I can trust him, right?	game/hospital.rpy	915	b "[what]"
samorshahar_d4cfcca9	b	And hopefully this way he can trust me.	game/hospital.rpy	916	b "[what]"
samorshahar_6088611c	b	I guess I'm done here. Doesn't look like there's any other patients of interest in this program.	game/hospital.rpy	917	b "[what]"
samorshahar_5e5cac37	b	Time to go check the other door in the guard common area.	game/hospital.rpy	918	b "[what]"
samorshahar_6f9cea6c	bi	I made my way through the common area to the other room.	game/hospital.rpy	920	bi "[what]"
samorshahar_882c6fc2	b	Huh, a supply closet.	game/hospital.rpy	923	b "[what]"
samorshahar_b5cac5ea	b	I guess even a mental hospital needs to get cleaned every now and then.	game/hospital.rpy	924	b "[what]"
samorshahar_86892f35	b	It's a bit dark in here, let me turn on the lights.	game/hospital.rpy	925	b "[what]"
samorshahar_2ed87469	b	...actually, after reading that sign, maybe I won't.	game/hospital.rpy	926	b "[what]"
samorshahar_5fc40163	b	Don't want to die for forgetting to flip a light switch.	game/hospital.rpy	927	b "[what]"
samorshahar_32f514ec	b	Let's see. There's a box of small unzippable plastic bags on the top shelf, fairly standard.	game/hospital.rpy	928	b "[what]"
samorshahar_43dbf966	b	Maybe they use those to distribute medicine here?	game/hospital.rpy	929	b "[what]"
samorshahar_71c62f14	b	The second shelf has a variety of cleaning supplies.	game/hospital.rpy	930	b "[what]"
samorshahar_1d8bd50a	b	Ammonia, bleach, ethanol, hydrogen peroxide...	game/hospital.rpy	931	b "[what]"
samorshahar_194aed85	b	All fairly standard stuff. I guess a mental hospital has less biohazards than a medical hospital.	game/hospital.rpy	932	b "[what]"
samorshahar_9eeb7a53	b	Below that, there's a stepstool. Maybe for maintenance workers?	game/hospital.rpy	933	b "[what]"
samorshahar_be27861f	b	And... a baseball bat.	game/hospital.rpy	934	b "[what]"
samorshahar_6de19941	b	That's not ominous at all...	game/hospital.rpy	935	b "[what]"
samorshahar_fc098582	b	Should I hide it? It's such an obvious choice for a murder weapon.	game/hospital.rpy	936	b "[what]"
samorshahar_deefc937	b	No, there's a rule that says it needs to be returned here.	game/hospital.rpy	937	b "[what]"
samorshahar_9ed32573	b	I don't really want to be the one to test if hiding it gets me "punished"...	game/hospital.rpy	938	b "[what]"
samorshahar_22d654d6	b	I guess... I'll just leave it here and let the others know so we're all vigilant about it.	game/hospital.rpy	939	b "[what]"
samorshahar_39927d3e	b	It can be like the kitchen knife in the mansion. If everyone's keeping an eye on it it's not a threat.	game/hospital.rpy	940	b "[what]"
samorshahar_6efd05d1	b	I think that's all I have to explore here, time to head to the kitchen.	game/hospital.rpy	941	b "[what]"
testwindow_0e969d85	bi	As I entered the kitchen, I looked through the window to the cafeteria, just to make sure...	game/hospital.rpy	948	bi "[what]"
testwindow_d900e5b2	bi	Phew, no one's been punished yet...	game/hospital.rpy	951	bi "[what]"
testwindow_fedb1b36	bi	They were all there.	game/hospital.rpy	952	bi "[what]"
testwindow_ba452273	j	Hey Bert, what'd you find?	game/hospital.rpy	953	j "[what]"
testwindow_466c160f	b	Well, there's what looks like a control or security room.	game/hospital.rpy	954	b "[what]"
testwindow_a25a9cca	b	Giant computer, can look at the cafeteria from there.	game/hospital.rpy	955	b "[what]"
testwindow_53bc143b	b	And some archives from this place.	game/hospital.rpy	956	b "[what]"
testwindow_0f0800e8	bi	I shouldn't tell her about Shahar...	game/hospital.rpy	957	bi "[what]"
testwindow_ef0620bb	b	Nothing too interesting though.	game/hospital.rpy	958	b "[what]"
testwindow_3646e74c	b	And then there's a closet with various cleaning supplies.	game/hospital.rpy	959	b "[what]"
testwindow_07beaa2b	b	I hope we won't have to use them...	game/hospital.rpy	960	b "[what]"
testwindow_a9640847	b	Oh, and a baseball bat.	game/hospital.rpy	961	b "[what]"
testwindow_71bf26bf	j	A baseball bat?	game/hospital.rpy	963	j "[what]"
testwindow_4b4d0306	b	Yeah... not sure why a mental hospital has a baseball bat in a supply closet.	game/hospital.rpy	964	b "[what]"
testwindow_b50b2255	j	I can uh... think of some not-so-great reasons.	game/hospital.rpy	965	j "[what]"
testwindow_06c8fae4	b	Oh.	game/hospital.rpy	966	b "[what]"
testwindow_83d7c402	b	Ohhhhh. This place just got a lot darker.	game/hospital.rpy	967	b "[what]"
testwindow_4594edeb	j	Should we take the bat and put it somewhere where everyone can see it?	game/hospital.rpy	968	j "[what]"
testwindow_2c9473b5	b	There's a sign in the closet that says to return everything... I'm afraid if we move it we get punished.	game/hospital.rpy	969	b "[what]"
testwindow_c2f6e7f1	b	After all, there was a punishment for not following the rules in the cafeteria.	game/hospital.rpy	970	b "[what]"
testwindow_14fca7d7	j	That sucks. Well, guess we'll just tell everyone.	game/hospital.rpy	971	j "[what]"
testwindow_65b41133	b	How's cooking going?	game/hospital.rpy	972	b "[what]"
testwindow_b2824cc5	j	It's okay. This kitchen is not nearly as well stocked as the mansion was.	game/hospital.rpy	973	j "[what]"
testwindow_b3e08ba6	j	The fridge only has the bare minimum, basic veggies like tomatoes and onions, a few broths.	game/hospital.rpy	974	j "[what]"
testwindow_257ed46d	j	The pots and pans are huge though, I guess because they're used to cooking for a large group.	game/hospital.rpy	975	j "[what]"
testwindow_c4317feb	j	So I'm cooking a big pot of tomato soup right now.	game/hospital.rpy	976	j "[what]"
testwindow_c2a9bb61	j	Nothing too fancy but that's about all I know how to do.	game/hospital.rpy	977	j "[what]"
testwindow_25562596	b	Can't say I have any fancier ideas...	game/hospital.rpy	978	b "[what]"
testwindow_70f3e7f6	b	Anything I can do to help?	game/hospital.rpy	979	b "[what]"
testwindow_6bf1db7c	j	Hmm, actually, do you mind if I explore a bit now that you're here?	game/hospital.rpy	980	j "[what]"
testwindow_c541385f	j	You'd just need to stir the pot every now and then, I can try to be back before it's done cooking.	game/hospital.rpy	981	j "[what]"
testwindow_cd9bbb9c	b	Sure, this would be a good chance for me to catch up with the others anyway.	game/hospital.rpy	982	b "[what]"
testwindow_6dcf85f3	j	Thanks Bert! Just to be safe, if it feels like 20 minutes have passed since I've left turn off the stove then.	game/hospital.rpy	984	j "[what]"
testwindow_52361b76	b	Got it, let me know if you find anything I missed.	game/hospital.rpy	985	b "[what]"
testwindow_b91afa48	j	Will do, seeya Bert!	game/hospital.rpy	986	j "[what]"
testwindow_c588e165	bi	I guess I haven't talked to the others yet...	game/hospital.rpy	990	bi "[what]"
testwindow_0e1cbb28	bi	I turned to the window and started chatting with the first person I saw.	game/hospital.rpy	991	bi "[what]"
testwindow_b2fcc6bf	d	Hello Bert. Are you here to brief us on the other side?	game/hospital.rpy	997	d "[what]"
testwindow_44bb9f1d	b	Uh... I guess I can, yeah.	game/hospital.rpy	998	b "[what]"
testwindow_9a84d405	d	Let me gather the others then, so you don't have to reexplain anything.	game/hospital.rpy	999	d "[what]"
testwindow_8ba6e1bb	f	Bert! Are you okay?	game/hospital.rpy	1002	f "[what]"
testwindow_991947e0	b	Oh, hey Freddy. Yeah I'm fine.	game/hospital.rpy	1003	b "[what]"
testwindow_01cd84ef	f	I got worried because Jenny showed up but you didn't.	game/hospital.rpy	1005	f "[what]"
testwindow_4a1493a0	f	And I thought... well...	game/hospital.rpy	1006	f "[what]"
testwindow_c32f414a	bi	Freddy sounded like he was on the verge of tears.	game/hospital.rpy	1007	bi "[what]"
testwindow_e8baec31	bi	Despite us trying to keep death away from him, he might have been thinking about it as much as the rest of us.	game/hospital.rpy	1008	bi "[what]"
testwindow_df9dc998	bi	Though maybe he didn't grasp how obvious it would be if Jenny murdered me on the first day...	game/hospital.rpy	1009	bi "[what]"
testwindow_a05999fd	b	I'm here Freddy, don't worry!	game/hospital.rpy	1010	b "[what]"
testwindow_d946cffb	f	Oh. Okay. Is the food almost ready?	game/hospital.rpy	1012	f "[what]"
testwindow_09035a99	bi	Children really are whimsical.	game/hospital.rpy	1013	bi "[what]"
testwindow_5dcc1071	bi	Dracula had gathered the others, except for Sam, and returned to the window.	game/hospital.rpy	1020	bi "[what]"
testwindow_6e84f925	d	Bert, you may begin your explanation.	game/hospital.rpy	1021	d "[what]"
testwindow_779fd12c	b	Alright...	game/hospital.rpy	1022	b "[what]"
testwindow_c3bf3ac2	bi	I briefly told them about the common area, control room, and supply closet.	game/hospital.rpy	1023	bi "[what]"
testwindow_298256bc	f	Baseball bat? Can we play sports in here?	game/hospital.rpy	1024	f "[what]"
testwindow_042be307	b	I uh... didn't see any baseballs or anything like that in here.	game/hospital.rpy	1025	b "[what]"
testwindow_529851c3	f	Oh. Maybe we can find one!	game/hospital.rpy	1026	f "[what]"
testwindow_5cf45f21	d	Hush child, there are business matters to discuss.	game/hospital.rpy	1027	d "[what]"
testwindow_ab7ea195	d	So you say you're afraid to take the baseball bat out of the closet?	game/hospital.rpy	1028	d "[what]"
testwindow_eb1d17c8	b	Yeah, there's a sign saying to return everything.	game/hospital.rpy	1029	b "[what]"
testwindow_de9ada29	b	I don't want to find out if breaking that rule kills me like the other rules.	game/hospital.rpy	1030	b "[what]"
testwindow_adfa3185	d	It seems unlikely, you could just try taking it out and see what happens.	game/hospital.rpy	1031	d "[what]"
testwindow_2a89bdbc	bi	Easy for you to say when you're on the other side...	game/hospital.rpy	1032	bi "[what]"
testwindow_e6961487	d	So there was no information in the control room of use?	game/hospital.rpy	1033	d "[what]"
testwindow_fac2caba	b	Nothing I saw, no. Though there are a lot of patients in the records so I didn't scroll through them all.	game/hospital.rpy	1034	b "[what]"
testwindow_fe285b47	bi	That should cover my bases...	game/hospital.rpy	1035	bi "[what]"
testwindow_5c91d9ef	d	Perhaps if you feel like helping the group, you could sift through the records with the rest of your free time today?	game/hospital.rpy	1036	d "[what]"
testwindow_676aff42	b	Uh...	game/hospital.rpy	1037	b "[what]"
testwindow_cf32b69b	l	Don't make him waste his time, you've done enough for him already Bert.	game/hospital.rpy	1041	l "[what]"
testwindow_27ba83a6	l	If you really wanna know, you can check on your own time Dracula.	game/hospital.rpy	1042	l "[what]"
testwindow_26080094	d	Hmph. Fine.	game/hospital.rpy	1043	d "[what]"
testwindow_d5a4300e	b	By the way, I heard the 5 minute reminder get announced this morning...	game/hospital.rpy	1044	b "[what]"
testwindow_0992ce06	b	Did everyone make it out of their cells in time?	game/hospital.rpy	1045	b "[what]"
testwindow_d9fe91bc	l	Yeah, we had to do some... convincing to get Sam out of bed.	game/hospital.rpy	1046	l "[what]"
testwindow_e63c2691	b	Is Sam doing any better?	game/hospital.rpy	1047	b "[what]"
testwindow_79e556c5	l	Not really. Mostly just sitting in the same seat.	game/hospital.rpy	1048	l "[what]"
testwindow_01a02762	b	That's... a little concerning, to put it lightly.	game/hospital.rpy	1049	b "[what]"
testwindow_47c6a1f0	l	Yeah. Don't worry about it for now, not much you can do on that end.	game/hospital.rpy	1050	l "[what]"
testwindow_0ca3542c	l	By the way, where's Jenny? Isn't she prepping a meal right now?	game/hospital.rpy	1051	l "[what]"
testwindow_b7b64e7a	bi	Shoot!	game/hospital.rpy	1052	bi "[what]"
testwindow_bc550ac3	b	Uh... yeah, I gotta go take care of that.	game/hospital.rpy	1053	b "[what]"
testwindow_758a6945	b	We'll let you guys know when it's ready.	game/hospital.rpy	1054	b "[what]"
testwindow_e0265dfd	bi	I turned to the soup and started stirring it.	game/hospital.rpy	1059	bi "[what]"
testwindow_42a7e37d	bi	After about 10 minutes, Jenny returned.	game/hospital.rpy	1060	bi "[what]"
testwindow_d21ddee9	j	Hey Bert! Everything okay here?	game/hospital.rpy	1064	j "[what]"
testwindow_1221e07d	b	Yup! Was definitely sitting here making sure nothing burned the whole time!	game/hospital.rpy	1065	b "[what]"
testwindow_ccd0951b	j	...You're acting suspicious.	game/hospital.rpy	1067	j "[what]"
testwindow_491f9ec1	b	Okay, I may have not stirred the soup until a few minutes after you left.	game/hospital.rpy	1068	b "[what]"
testwindow_b500c4e3	j	Bert, it's tomato soup. Not a steak or anything like that.	game/hospital.rpy	1069	j "[what]"
testwindow_6f8b5552	j	Worst case we just don't serve the burnt soup at the bottom.	game/hospital.rpy	1070	j "[what]"
testwindow_1c7450dc	j	As long as Sesame didn't vomit in the soup or anything like that.	game/hospital.rpy	1071	j "[what]"
testwindow_51877a1f	b	Oh shoot, I totally forgot about Sesame!	game/hospital.rpy	1072	b "[what]"
testwindow_f65a6d04	bi	I quickly scanned the room to locate him.	game/hospital.rpy	1073	bi "[what]"
testwindow_7feb2f69	bi	Thankfully, Sesame was just curled up on one of the tables sleeping.	game/hospital.rpy	1074	bi "[what]"
testwindow_71467a0b	bi	I guess cats are known for sleeping a lot...	game/hospital.rpy	1075	bi "[what]"
testwindow_9109de4e	b	Did you find anything?	game/hospital.rpy	1076	b "[what]"
testwindow_961e671e	j	Nope. I thought about looking through the records but then I decided it was too boring.	game/hospital.rpy	1077	j "[what]"
testwindow_5fd3a9b6	j	Besides, I'm sure if there were something interesting you would have found it.	game/hospital.rpy	1078	j "[what]"
testwindow_ea3bca4d	j	Oh! But there is something secret in here!	game/hospital.rpy	1080	j "[what]"
testwindow_35ba70ca	b	What?	game/hospital.rpy	1081	b "[what]"
testwindow_4286ebd6	j	Check the fridge, second level from the top.	game/hospital.rpy	1082	j "[what]"
testwindow_3c19d7b3	bi	I opened the fridge and found...	game/hospital.rpy	1083	bi "[what]"
testwindow_79b5ac8d	bi	A cupcake.	game/hospital.rpy	1084	bi "[what]"
testwindow_ecf832db	bi	Red velvet with what looked like cream cheese frosting...	game/hospital.rpy	1085	bi "[what]"
testwindow_cb96beb6	j	There were two when I found them but uh...	game/hospital.rpy	1087	j "[what]"
testwindow_29ecabca	j	Well, one of them magically disappeared!	game/hospital.rpy	1089	j "[what]"
testwindow_206fcc2f	bi	A likely story.	game/hospital.rpy	1090	bi "[what]"
testwindow_6d0b8243	j	Anyway Bert, you should have the other one.	game/hospital.rpy	1091	j "[what]"
testwindow_a4352d30	j	No one else will know, unless the next guards dig through the trash.	game/hospital.rpy	1092	j "[what]"
testwindow_50028cf4	j	And you deserve a reward for all the hard work you've put in!	game/hospital.rpy	1093	j "[what]"
testwindow_dda9e030	b	Jenny... I don't know, it feels like I'd be lying to the others out there.	game/hospital.rpy	1094	b "[what]"
testwindow_aac440bf	b	Shouldn't we try to build trust instead of hiding something from them?	game/hospital.rpy	1095	b "[what]"
testwindow_cbe11983	j	It's just a cupcake Bert, it's not a big deal.	game/hospital.rpy	1097	j "[what]"
testwindow_2bdd5070	j	It's not like hiding our pasts or how we're criminals.	game/hospital.rpy	1098	j "[what]"
testwindow_ec12c07f	j	You're making me feel bad for having a giant sweet tooth...	game/hospital.rpy	1099	j "[what]"
testwindow_cfbc5d8d	b	No, I'm not trying to make you feel bad!	game/hospital.rpy	1100	b "[what]"
testwindow_9a945d31	bi	I hate these types of scenarios.	game/hospital.rpy	1101	bi "[what]"
testwindow_a16eb5dd	bi	Where you don't personally feel like you could do something but can understand why others do.	game/hospital.rpy	1102	bi "[what]"
testwindow_54232615	bi	Like being the vegetarian friend who watches their friends eat meat.	game/hospital.rpy	1103	bi "[what]"
testwindow_c864953c	bi	Or not caring much about social media but your friends are upset when you don't like their posts.	game/hospital.rpy	1104	bi "[what]"
testwindow_6ce6298f	bi	What should I do?	game/hospital.rpy	1106	bi "[what]" nointeract
testwindow_8ca05600	b	Okay, you're right, it's not a big deal.	game/hospital.rpy	1110	b "[what]"
testwindow_49962e9e	b	And I have been "carrying the team" so to speak.	game/hospital.rpy	1111	b "[what]"
testwindow_4d612b53	b	Besides, for all we know the Game Master will restock the fridge tonight.	game/hospital.rpy	1112	b "[what]"
testwindow_f5f342fa	bi	I didn't actually believe that, but I said it to make her feel better.	game/hospital.rpy	1113	bi "[what]"
testwindow_3bcbe32c	j	Yay! Dig in Bert, you deserve it!	game/hospital.rpy	1115	j "[what]"
testwindow_6004f838	bi	I unpeeled the wrapper and started biting into the cupcake.	game/hospital.rpy	1116	bi "[what]"
testwindow_61b6b642	bi	I won't lie, if only for a split second, the taste of frosting made me feel happy.	game/hospital.rpy	1117	bi "[what]"
testwindow_6f92c4b2	b	Oh Jenny, I never talked to you about the whole Mr. Sydell thing.	game/hospital.rpy	1118	b "[what]"
testwindow_8e996229	b	I take it you never met him?	game/hospital.rpy	1119	b "[what]"
testwindow_1f3035ba	j	Nope, haven't heard the name until now.	game/hospital.rpy	1121	j "[what]"
testwindow_afda854d	j	Do you know anything, Bert?	game/hospital.rpy	1122	j "[what]"
testwindow_5dfdfbae	b	I don't, but Stella told me something while we were in the mansion.	game/hospital.rpy	1123	b "[what]"
testwindow_abe5f0ee	b	She said something about how she "hires suits to step on guys like him."	game/hospital.rpy	1124	b "[what]"
testwindow_624bbf75	j	...What does that mean?	game/hospital.rpy	1125	j "[what]"
testwindow_b4fa3fc0	j	...	game/hospital.rpy	1126	j "[what]"
testwindow_7a371e3f	j	Oh! I remember once seeing on TV something about how Cantoire Holdings sued a smaller company.	game/hospital.rpy	1127	j "[what]"
testwindow_5885fcbb	j	They failed to fulfill an order by one of their clients owned by Cantoire Holdings.	game/hospital.rpy	1128	j "[what]"
testwindow_8cb7b7f9	j	So Cantoire Holdings sued them.	game/hospital.rpy	1129	j "[what]"
testwindow_3c25da50	j	They won the lawsuit, and the smaller company couldn't pay out so they went bankrupt.	game/hospital.rpy	1130	j "[what]"
testwindow_d29c583f	j	Do you think that's what she meant?	game/hospital.rpy	1131	j "[what]"
testwindow_929084fc	b	Maybe... do you think Mr. Sydell owns a company like that?	game/hospital.rpy	1132	b "[what]"
testwindow_171aa291	j	No clue. But it would make sense.	game/hospital.rpy	1133	j "[what]"
testwindow_5473ff7d	j	Maybe this whole game is orchestrated by him as revenge on Stella?	game/hospital.rpy	1134	j "[what]"
testwindow_b0aa73cf	j	If he owns a company he would have the money to put together something like this.	game/hospital.rpy	1135	j "[what]"
testwindow_9da6020b	b	Why are the rest of us here though?	game/hospital.rpy	1136	b "[what]"
testwindow_6631743a	b	Not like I helped Stella take down any company...	game/hospital.rpy	1137	b "[what]"
testwindow_63e19176	b	I'd never met her before this happened.	game/hospital.rpy	1138	b "[what]"
testwindow_46ad357f	b	And now Stella's dead, couldn't the game just be over.	game/hospital.rpy	1139	b "[what]"
testwindow_8975e6ec	j	Hm... maybe this theory is wrong then?	game/hospital.rpy	1140	j "[what]"
testwindow_4dd48b9a	b	Maybe. There's other ways to be rich enough to host this kind of game and be upset at Stella.	game/hospital.rpy	1141	b "[what]"
testwindow_43574011	b	I'd imagine many people in the world are already upset at a CEO like Stella anyway.	game/hospital.rpy	1142	b "[what]"
testwindow_d2b40918	b	For all we know this is some vigilante justice against random criminals with no connection...	game/hospital.rpy	1143	b "[what]"
testwindow_a246e56f	j	I don't think it's a coincidence he keeps coming up though.	game/hospital.rpy	1144	j "[what]"
testwindow_1ce34ee8	b	You're right, I'm just... speculating, I guess.	game/hospital.rpy	1145	b "[what]"
testwindow_302cb1a4	j	Oh, looks like the soup is almost done!	game/hospital.rpy	1146	j "[what]"
testwindow_cf7891bb	j	Want to help me serve it, Bert?	game/hospital.rpy	1147	j "[what]"
testwindow_80ff5c79	b	Yeah, let's do it.	game/hospital.rpy	1148	b "[what]"
testwindow_3c924703	b	Sorry Jenny... I think I'm going to tell the others about it.	game/hospital.rpy	1153	b "[what]"
testwindow_af5471f9	b	See if any of them want it more than I do.	game/hospital.rpy	1154	b "[what]"
testwindow_144028db	j	Bert... they're all going to hate me if they know I ate it without telling them!	game/hospital.rpy	1155	j "[what]"
testwindow_21effb2e	b	If you want I won't tell them you ate one. I'll just say there was only one.	game/hospital.rpy	1156	b "[what]"
testwindow_6a80e091	b	I don't think they'll have a reason to think we're lying if I give them one cupcake.	game/hospital.rpy	1157	b "[what]"
testwindow_8f4f62c9	j	Hmph. Okay.	game/hospital.rpy	1158	j "[what]"
testwindow_cf62116c	bi	She turned away from me and stirred the soup.	game/hospital.rpy	1159	bi "[what]"
testwindow_4700bf13	bi	I think she was upset, but I don't feel like I did anything that merited it...	game/hospital.rpy	1160	bi "[what]"
testwindow_15c1a861	bi	We sat there in silence, her cooking, me staring at the wall, until she was done.	game/hospital.rpy	1161	bi "[what]"
testwindow_af489f5b	bi	Well, hopefully this will blow over soon.	game/hospital.rpy	1162	bi "[what]"
testwindow_70126a61	bi	Time to serve the meal...	game/hospital.rpy	1163	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_3833914d	bi	Hm... I should try to find a way to talk to Shahar discreetly while everyone's eating.	game/hospital.rpy	1166	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_feadc9ff	j	Food's ready!	game/hospital.rpy	1167	j "[what]"
postcupcake_46f7a653	bi	The others gathered in a line to get their serving.	game/hospital.rpy	1168	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_b16855b8	i	Oh wow! This smells delicious!	game/hospital.rpy	1175	i "[what]"
postcupcake_82a1c4c3	j	You don't need to flatter me Sid. It's really simple compared to our last meal...	game/hospital.rpy	1176	j "[what]"
postcupcake_3bd129ac	i	Technically we had sleep for dinner yesterday.	game/hospital.rpy	1177	i "[what]"
postcupcake_d12887e1	j	I'm sure when you're a guard you'll make something even better Sid.	game/hospital.rpy	1180	j "[what]"
postcupcake_02e08447	i	Hmm, I only know how to make very simple stuff...	game/hospital.rpy	1181	i "[what]"
postcupcake_22d43e4a	i	We didn't have a very stocked kitchen when I was growing up.	game/hospital.rpy	1183	i "[what]"
postcupcake_74cfbb18	i	Sometimes we just got fast food because my parents were too tired from working to cook...	game/hospital.rpy	1184	i "[what]"
postcupcake_b96d47a5	j	Hm... well now's just as good a chance as any to learn to cook!	game/hospital.rpy	1185	j "[what]"
postcupcake_af0f20db	j	When we get out of here, it's a really useful skill to have.	game/hospital.rpy	1186	j "[what]"
postcupcake_6a544dee	i	I guess so...	game/hospital.rpy	1187	i "[what]"
postcupcake_3b83899c	j	Plus, you can impress the ladies!	game/hospital.rpy	1188	j "[what]"
postcupcake_f26c9e20	i	Um... you're being weird, Jenny.	game/hospital.rpy	1189	i "[what]"
postcupcake_b9cdc77a	j	Oh.	game/hospital.rpy	1192	j "[what]"
postcupcake_16c9a649	j	Never mind then...	game/hospital.rpy	1193	j "[what]"
postcupcake_e39d1abe	h	Aye lassy, what rations have ye prepped for us?	game/hospital.rpy	1196	h "[what]"
postcupcake_07095489	h	My head's achin', some food ought to get me metabolism back in check.	game/hospital.rpy	1197	h "[what]"
postcupcake_0b58962e	j	Tomato soup, here you go.	game/hospital.rpy	1198	j "[what]"
postcupcake_522fa884	h	Ah, this reminds me of the soup me matey Jackson would prep on the ship.	game/hospital.rpy	1199	h "[what]"
postcupcake_10634465	bi	Jackson's an... interesting name for a pirate.	game/hospital.rpy	1200	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_a097f73f	h	The smell's almost the exact same!	game/hospital.rpy	1201	h "[what]"
postcupcake_c768acb2	b	Do they stock tomatoes on pirate ships?	game/hospital.rpy	1202	b "[what]"
postcupcake_361c35a9	b	Seems like they would spoil at sea, I thought pirates mostly ate dry food.	game/hospital.rpy	1203	b "[what]"
postcupcake_f23c1856	h	I don't know lad, I ne'er went into the ship's kitchen.	game/hospital.rpy	1204	h "[what]"
postcupcake_6bb1d545	h	Can't defend against buccaneers if yer stuck in there, and I was the strongest man on the ship.	game/hospital.rpy	1205	h "[what]"
postcupcake_87f2b432	bi	Like everything Shahar said, this didn't make a lot of sense, but...	game/hospital.rpy	1206	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_fe4563ac	bi	Shahar's head hurt and he got upset last time I kept questioning him.	game/hospital.rpy	1207	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_3829a244	h	Anyway, cheers lassy, I'm off to feast!	game/hospital.rpy	1208	h "[what]"
postcupcake_067641e6	j	Hey guys, here's your soup!	game/hospital.rpy	1215	j "[what]"
postcupcake_c2ed4676	l	Thanks.	game/hospital.rpy	1216	l "[what]"
postcupcake_bf882935	f	Thanks! I'm so hungry...	game/hospital.rpy	1217	f "[what]"
postcupcake_8b9df210	l	Apparently Freddy growing up had a bunch of fruits to snack on.	game/hospital.rpy	1218	l "[what]"
postcupcake_c6837395	l	There doesn't happen to be any in the kitchen for him, is there?	game/hospital.rpy	1219	l "[what]"
postcupcake_a80affbd	j	I didn't see any...	game/hospital.rpy	1220	j "[what]"
postcupcake_79956767	j	Except tomatoes! They're technically fruits!	game/hospital.rpy	1223	j "[what]"
postcupcake_5866cff4	j	So this soup is like a smoothie if you think about it!	game/hospital.rpy	1224	j "[what]"
postcupcake_850ef128	b	...	game/hospital.rpy	1225	b "[what]"
postcupcake_82822a0c	l	...	game/hospital.rpy	1226	l "[what]"
postcupcake_3ec57d49	f	...	game/hospital.rpy	1227	f "[what]"
postcupcake_7e212fc9	bi	I don't think that was a very convincing argument.	game/hospital.rpy	1228	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_1212d62b	l	Sorry Freddy, but this is at least healthy for you.	game/hospital.rpy	1229	l "[what]"
postcupcake_c48b6088	l	We'll need all the energy we can get, right?	game/hospital.rpy	1230	l "[what]"
postcupcake_52af1c8f	f	Yeah... I am tired...	game/hospital.rpy	1231	f "[what]"
postcupcake_8d95494c	bi	Hm... wait.	game/hospital.rpy	1233	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_3066c9a1	bi	I think Freddy would really like this cupcake.	game/hospital.rpy	1234	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_161226f7	bi	It probably won't give him actual energy, but...	game/hospital.rpy	1235	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_d5e90af3	b	Hey Freddy, do you want a cupcake?	game/hospital.rpy	1236	b "[what]"
postcupcake_a465a393	b	We found one in the fridge, you should take it.	game/hospital.rpy	1237	b "[what]"
postcupcake_5eeb5978	b	We're all old adults, so we don't appreciate sweet food as much as you do.	game/hospital.rpy	1238	b "[what]"
postcupcake_f6172cb5	bi	Jenny turned away as I was saying this.	game/hospital.rpy	1241	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_0fc475ad	f	Cupcake?	game/hospital.rpy	1242	f "[what]"
postcupcake_f5d228f7	b	Yeah. It's all yours.	game/hospital.rpy	1243	b "[what]"
postcupcake_1f742dca	f	Wow. Thanks so much Bert!	game/hospital.rpy	1244	f "[what]"
postcupcake_9b951bd9	l	Alright Freddy, let's save that for dessert, finish your soup first.	game/hospital.rpy	1245	l "[what]"
postcupcake_30548f94	f	But I wanna eat the cupcake!	game/hospital.rpy	1246	f "[what]"
postcupcake_fd7adfad	l	If you eat it first you'll ruin your appetite...	game/hospital.rpy	1247	l "[what]"
postcupcake_d8695a2f	l	Thanks Jenny and Bert. Looking forward to the meal.	game/hospital.rpy	1248	l "[what]"
postcupcake_a2e5c203	j	You're welcome!	game/hospital.rpy	1251	j "[what]"
postcupcake_9bd60cf6	l	Thanks Jenny. Looking forward to the meal.	game/hospital.rpy	1253	l "[what]"
postcupcake_a2e5c203_1	j	You're welcome!	game/hospital.rpy	1254	j "[what]"
postcupcake_0feb83de	d	I am looking forward to this tomato soup.	game/hospital.rpy	1259	d "[what]"
postcupcake_0d724a51	j	Really?	game/hospital.rpy	1260	j "[what]"
postcupcake_4591bbda	d	Yes, it reminds me of blood.	game/hospital.rpy	1261	d "[what]"
postcupcake_048eb361	d	A bit more orange than blood is, but still.	game/hospital.rpy	1262	d "[what]"
postcupcake_13bdc065	d	It gives me some nostalgia for before this game.	game/hospital.rpy	1263	d "[what]"
postcupcake_298087ed	bi	I highly doubt any vampire actually thinks tomatoes look like blood...	game/hospital.rpy	1264	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_8f86c1c5	d	Good day.	game/hospital.rpy	1265	d "[what]"
postcupcake_c4f18d9e	j	Good day, Dracula!	game/hospital.rpy	1266	j "[what]"
postcupcake_bf758e92	b	...wait, there's an extra serving.	game/hospital.rpy	1271	b "[what]"
postcupcake_54435127	b	Has anyone not come up yet?	game/hospital.rpy	1272	b "[what]"
postcupcake_a2557e3d	j	I think it's Sam.	game/hospital.rpy	1273	j "[what]"
postcupcake_a9ca9f9a	b	Oh...	game/hospital.rpy	1274	b "[what]"
postcupcake_89a9190a	bi	I hadn't noticed, but Sam hadn't even come to the windows like the others.	game/hospital.rpy	1275	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_bf7dc3a8	bi	Sam was instead sitting in the same seat, staring at the ground.	game/hospital.rpy	1276	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_9bfd6960	b	Sam needs to eat... maybe we can call Lauren over to help us help Sam?	game/hospital.rpy	1277	b "[what]"
postcupcake_e6f3b908	j	Do you mind taking care of that Bert?	game/hospital.rpy	1278	j "[what]"
postcupcake_0a20b529	j	I think Sam takes you more seriously than me, and I wanted to clean up the kitchen.	game/hospital.rpy	1279	j "[what]"
postcupcake_6da9e763	b	Uh... yeah, I guess Lauren and I are enough to help Sam out for now.	game/hospital.rpy	1280	b "[what]"
postcupcake_95cba1d8	j	Sweet! I'm gonna go to the supply closet and choose a cleaner, if you need me.	game/hospital.rpy	1281	j "[what]"
postcupcake_8ede0042	j	Seeya Bert!	game/hospital.rpy	1282	j "[what]"
postcupcake_7da3b7e8	bi	That's... moderately suspicious.	game/hospital.rpy	1284	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_264128ad	bi	The kitchen's not that dirty, and it's not like we'll be here that long...	game/hospital.rpy	1285	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_fde0b2f1	bi	Oh well, I have a slightly more important thing... er, person to worry about.	game/hospital.rpy	1286	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_acac2975	b	Lauren! Can you come here?	game/hospital.rpy	1287	b "[what]"
postcupcake_f22edb13	l	Hey Bert, something wrong?	game/hospital.rpy	1289	l "[what]"
postcupcake_cc93dfc4	b	Sam never came to grab a bowl of soup.	game/hospital.rpy	1290	b "[what]"
postcupcake_54c4817e	b	Can you help me bring Sam here to eat?	game/hospital.rpy	1291	b "[what]"
postcupcake_81d13b24	l	Sure, give me a second.	game/hospital.rpy	1292	l "[what]"
postcupcake_7dd92dde	bi	Lauren went over and somewhat forcefully got Sam to stand up and walk to the kitchen window.	game/hospital.rpy	1294	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_3894ff04	s	What do you want...	game/hospital.rpy	1300	s "[what]"
postcupcake_4b9f4e63	b	We wanted you to eat your meal.	game/hospital.rpy	1301	b "[what]"

postcupcake_526fc795	b	Sam, you need to eat.	game/hospital.rpy	1303	b "[what]"
postcupcake_dddfb9a5	s	I'm not hungry...	game/hospital.rpy	1304	s "[what]"
postcupcake_ffaf5666	b	It's soup, it'll go down effortlessly. We need calories in you so you can keep going.	game/hospital.rpy	1305	b "[what]"
postcupcake_097b8595	s	Why are you all trying to keep a murderer alive...	game/hospital.rpy	1306	s "[what]"
postcupcake_6567aead	l	Sam, you're not a murderer.	game/hospital.rpy	1307	l "[what]"
postcupcake_76c00dea	s	I might as well be.	game/hospital.rpy	1308	s "[what]"
postcupcake_426d6f2d	l	Sam, take it from someone who actaully murdered someone.	game/hospital.rpy	1309	l "[what]"
postcupcake_ac2f74b9	bi	...	game/hospital.rpy	1310	bi "[what]"

postcupcake_77b7e1c0	l	I don't want to go into details.	game/hospital.rpy	1314	l "[what]"
postcupcake_c934fa88	l	But I once was in a dangerous situation in public with a robber.	game/hospital.rpy	1315	l "[what]"
postcupcake_1e4552d4	l	I had a gun on me, and I thought my life was at risk, so I...	game/hospital.rpy	1316	l "[what]"
postcupcake_1f657b4d	l	I took three shots.	game/hospital.rpy	1317	l "[what]"
postcupcake_5e3b6d7a	l	I still don't know if that was the right move, I never will.	game/hospital.rpy	1318	l "[what]"

postcupcake_95a32153	l	She died.	game/hospital.rpy	1325	l "[what]"
postcupcake_02f56684	l	Thankfully based on security footage I wasn't taken to court.	game/hospital.rpy	1326	l "[what]"
postcupcake_d059587b	l	I got to live an "innocent" citizen.	game/hospital.rpy	1327	l "[what]"
postcupcake_e4b64ffc	l	But it took me a long time to move past that day.	game/hospital.rpy	1328	l "[what]"
postcupcake_de73aa21	l	Every day I woke up and I'd see her face.	game/hospital.rpy	1329	l "[what]"
postcupcake_ace43758	l	Every night when I tried to sleep I heard her scream.	game/hospital.rpy	1330	l "[what]"
postcupcake_08c9c59c	l	About a year after it happened, someone came to our place.	game/hospital.rpy	1331	l "[what]"

postcupcake_ed91dbd2	l	He said at first he was angry.	game/hospital.rpy	1334	l "[what]"
postcupcake_55668bdb	l	Wanted to press charges, send me to jail, ruin my life.	game/hospital.rpy	1335	l "[what]"
postcupcake_500e9e8e	l	But he said he didn't feel right blaming me.	game/hospital.rpy	1336	l "[what]"
postcupcake_2ef10b33	l	Knew I was someone else's daughter, who happened to be caught near a bad guy.	game/hospital.rpy	1337	l "[what]"

postcupcake_1d0b6a15	l	So he said he forgave me. And asked me to forgive myself.	game/hospital.rpy	1339	l "[what]"
postcupcake_8c5bf44a	l	I never heard from him after that.	game/hospital.rpy	1340	l "[what]"
postcupcake_f593e093	l	I don't think I've fully forgiven myself for what happened that day.	game/hospital.rpy	1341	l "[what]"

postcupcake_402cb2e7	l	Thanks to me... no, thanks to that robber, the girl lost the chance to live her life fully.	game/hospital.rpy	1346	l "[what]"

postcupcake_ee429734	l	At this point I don't care if the others know.	game/hospital.rpy	1363	l "[what]"
postcupcake_27b25814	l	I just want to get out.	game/hospital.rpy	1364	l "[what]"

postcupcake_bdfeea27	b	Uh... we're trying to get out?	game/hospital.rpy	1379	b "[what]"

postcupcake_fa1f5217	l	If it means becoming the pariah of this group instead of Sam...	game/hospital.rpy	1383	l "[what]"
postcupcake_744dc968	l	I'll make that trade to give Sam a chance to get out of here.	game/hospital.rpy	1384	l "[what]"
postcupcake_850ef128_1	b	...	game/hospital.rpy	1385	b "[what]"
postcupcake_82822a0c_1	l	...	game/hospital.rpy	1386	l "[what]"
postcupcake_2b2b9f14	bi	I should've said something, but I didn't.	game/hospital.rpy	1387	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_dd1f7e21	bi	Taking that as a cue, Lauren walked off.	game/hospital.rpy	1388	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_be93942c	j	Hey Bert, I'm gonna start cleaning the kitchen up.	game/hospital.rpy	1392	j "[what]"
postcupcake_8c4bada8	j	You don't have to do anything, I enjoy cleaning!	game/hospital.rpy	1393	j "[what]"
postcupcake_79088200	j	It might be a good time to talk to the others if you haven't already.	game/hospital.rpy	1394	j "[what]"
postcupcake_a6d044af	j	There's some time to go until we have to make another meal, have to kill that time somehow.	game/hospital.rpy	1395	j "[what]"
postcupcake_721ebdf0	b	I'd talked to Lauren and Sam, but I guess I could talk to them more or talk to someone else.	game/hospital.rpy	1396	b "[what]"
postcupcake_2c1cd253	blank	FREE TIME 5 HERE	game/hospital.rpy	1399	blank "[what]"
postcupcake_ef0f5dbe	j	And, all done with cleaning!	game/hospital.rpy	1401	j "[what]"
postcupcake_535096c5	j	I'm gonna go relax in the lounge, Bert.	game/hospital.rpy	1402	j "[what]"
postcupcake_67731e30	b	You don't want to talk to the others?	game/hospital.rpy	1403	b "[what]"
postcupcake_178748da	j	No, I'm pretty tired. Plus, I need to figure out what's for dinner...	game/hospital.rpy	1404	j "[what]"
postcupcake_6afd471c	j	If you want to join me feel free, but I'm fine being alone for a bit.	game/hospital.rpy	1405	j "[what]"
postcupcake_ef2beaf6	j	Just don't kill me while I'm there! That'd be too obvious.	game/hospital.rpy	1407	j "[what]"
postcupcake_5b61efe4	b	Haha, I'd never do that...	game/hospital.rpy	1408	b "[what]"
postcupcake_a4e1b5ab	bi	Forget Freddy, does Jenny comprehend how serious this situation is?	game/hospital.rpy	1409	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_b5d02795	bi	Hm... this is my chance, I think.	game/hospital.rpy	1411	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_473845e5	b	Hey Shahar, can I talk to you for a second?	game/hospital.rpy	1414	b "[what]"
postcupcake_3b732551	h	Mate, what's on yer mind?	game/hospital.rpy	1416	h "[what]"
postcupcake_3210bcee	b	I wanted to tell you something.	game/hospital.rpy	1417	b "[what]"
postcupcake_a75ab8fc	b	I think we should keep it a secret though. It's something that might make you look suspicious.	game/hospital.rpy	1418	b "[what]"
postcupcake_737f8c7f	bi	Well... more suspicious than the pirate getup already does.	game/hospital.rpy	1419	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_55a867e7	h	Suspicious? Lad, what would ye landlubbers suspect me for? Being a pirate? I am one!	game/hospital.rpy	1420	h "[what]"
postcupcake_0ed6cb63	b	Shahar, did you figure out if you've ever been here before?	game/hospital.rpy	1421	b "[what]"
postcupcake_05f4288a	h	Ye lad, I was in the cafeteria yesterday. What's yer point?	game/hospital.rpy	1422	h "[what]"
postcupcake_31ba17e0	b	No, that's not what I meant...	game/hospital.rpy	1423	b "[what]"
postcupcake_9e72ba0e	h	Well then be clearer lad, else nary a soul here will understand ye!	game/hospital.rpy	1424	h "[what]"
postcupcake_cd2a39b2	b	I mean... have you been here before the game started?	game/hospital.rpy	1425	b "[what]"
postcupcake_941e174c	b	In the hospital?	game/hospital.rpy	1426	b "[what]"
postcupcake_9bcd2b14	h	I... I feel like I have lad, but me memories of here don't exist.	game/hospital.rpy	1427	h "[what]"
postcupcake_e7139699	h	Like what ye landlubbers call... deja vu?	game/hospital.rpy	1428	h "[what]"
postcupcake_31d2a2e1	b	Okay, Shahar don't tell anyone this.	game/hospital.rpy	1429	b "[what]"
postcupcake_4343928d	b	But... I scrolled through the hospital records, and your name was in there.	game/hospital.rpy	1430	b "[what]"
postcupcake_2fded262	h	...	game/hospital.rpy	1431	h "[what]"
postcupcake_705ce3df	b	So I think you've been here before, it's not just deja vu.	game/hospital.rpy	1432	b "[what]"
postcupcake_cc2d9ea0	h	What did it say lad? What can't I remember?	game/hospital.rpy	1433	h "[what]"
postcupcake_5f093847	b	It only said "patient thinks he is a pirate," nothing else.	game/hospital.rpy	1434	b "[what]"
postcupcake_8d6ecb0e	b	It's almost like someone wiped most of your information.	game/hospital.rpy	1435	b "[what]"
postcupcake_081a36e2	h	"Thinks he is a pirate?"	game/hospital.rpy	1436	h "[what]"
postcupcake_6b174dfb	h	Lad, I think I'm a pirate because I am a pirate!	game/hospital.rpy	1438	h "[what]"
postcupcake_c51e8f0a	h	How can I trust ye lad, ye might be thinkin' I'm an addle you can swindle and kill.	game/hospital.rpy	1439	h "[what]"
postcupcake_54061ddd	b	Trust me?	game/hospital.rpy	1440	b "[what]"
postcupcake_850ef128_2	b	...	game/hospital.rpy	1441	b "[what]"
postcupcake_d220bcb7	bi	No, he's right.	game/hospital.rpy	1443	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_4383ba6c	bi	I thought we could trust Catherine in the mansion, but I was wrong.	game/hospital.rpy	1444	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_255f5923	bi	Shahar might feel the same way towards me.	game/hospital.rpy	1445	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_4f13eaae	bi	I could ask others to check the records so he knows I'm not lying but...	game/hospital.rpy	1446	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_d17c13ae	bi	Then the others might not trust him.	game/hospital.rpy	1447	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_fb76ec10	bi	Trust for trust...	game/hospital.rpy	1448	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_50c2c263	bi	This isn't important enough to get Shahar potentially lynched by the others...	game/hospital.rpy	1449	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_c87305d4	b	Yeah, you're right Shahar.	game/hospital.rpy	1450	b "[what]"
postcupcake_7a21fbca	b	Sorry to bother lad.	game/hospital.rpy	1451	b "[what]"
postcupcake_ae5fc223	h	Aye lad.	game/hospital.rpy	1452	h "[what]"
postcupcake_4867d77d	bi	He stormed off...	game/hospital.rpy	1454	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_eacd0291	bi	That didn't go as planned.	game/hospital.rpy	1455	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_e9b83ac5	bi	Was there anything I could have done to convince him to trust me?	game/hospital.rpy	1456	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_9475142a	b	Shahar, earlier, I gave Freddy a cupcake.	game/hospital.rpy	1458	b "[what]"
postcupcake_884e0454	b	I could have just eaten it myself and told no one about it...	game/hospital.rpy	1459	b "[what]"
postcupcake_07068e62	b	But I didn't want to lie to people about it.	game/hospital.rpy	1460	b "[what]"
postcupcake_6686d66b	b	Even if it was a lie by omission.	game/hospital.rpy	1461	b "[what]"
postcupcake_9cc9d93c	b	If I wouldn't lie about something trivial like that, would I lie to you about this?	game/hospital.rpy	1462	b "[what]"
postcupcake_2fded262_1	h	...	game/hospital.rpy	1463	h "[what]"
postcupcake_e2fa7926	h	Bert, me head don't work as good as it used to.	game/hospital.rpy	1464	h "[what]"
postcupcake_f500bdb5	h	And it didn't need to work that good for me to be a pirate.	game/hospital.rpy	1465	h "[what]"
postcupcake_b024137d	h	I don't know me a lot, but...	game/hospital.rpy	1466	h "[what]"
postcupcake_8c207975	h	Somehow I know I can trust ye Bert.	game/hospital.rpy	1467	h "[what]"
postcupcake_1dcc680b	h	The way ye speak, I can tell yer a true comrade.	game/hospital.rpy	1468	h "[what]"
postcupcake_26904f44	h	Yer keepin' this a secret fer me Bert, I appreciate that.	game/hospital.rpy	1469	h "[what]"
postcupcake_b1c9d097	h	So I'll tell ye something too, but ye must keep it a secret.	game/hospital.rpy	1470	h "[what]"
postcupcake_2502b8a7	h	Not that I think ye won't...	game/hospital.rpy	1471	h "[what]"
postcupcake_aed5ed01	h	If ye wanted to maroon me, the others would've known I've been here by now.	game/hospital.rpy	1472	h "[what]"
postcupcake_e05ff8be	b	Of course, Shahar. Your secrets are safe with me.	game/hospital.rpy	1473	b "[what]"
postcupcake_7f245718	h	I... think you're right. I only think I was a pirate.	game/hospital.rpy	1474	h "[what]"
postcupcake_423fa8aa	h	In my pirate memories... something is weird.	game/hospital.rpy	1475	h "[what]"
postcupcake_5a681b88	h	The others tell me to shut up, that I'm sitting at a table, not a crow's nest.	game/hospital.rpy	1476	h "[what]"
postcupcake_26370894	h	I was the captain, why would I shut up?	game/hospital.rpy	1477	h "[what]"
postcupcake_b571b87e	b	Did you think they didn't realize it was a crow's nest?	game/hospital.rpy	1478	b "[what]"
postcupcake_342a867d	h	I... I thought maybe me mateys were using pirate words I hadn't heard of.	game/hospital.rpy	1479	h "[what]"
postcupcake_621a8205	h	Like how ye landlubbers don't know what cackle fruit is.	game/hospital.rpy	1480	h "[what]"
postcupcake_52149fd3	h	Maybe table means crow's nest?	game/hospital.rpy	1481	h "[what]"
postcupcake_749fdc9d	h	That's what I thought. But like I said Bert, me head didn't need to work that good as a pirate.	game/hospital.rpy	1482	h "[what]"
postcupcake_06b34cd8	h	Should I even talk like this if I'm not a pirate, matey?	game/hospital.rpy	1483	h "[what]"
postcupcake_3be7b52b	h	Should I just call you... pal?	game/hospital.rpy	1484	h "[what]"
postcupcake_850ef128_3	b	...	game/hospital.rpy	1485	b "[what]"
postcupcake_7c376709	b	Keep calling me matey, Shahar.	game/hospital.rpy	1486	b "[what]"
postcupcake_e8dad960	b	The Shahar I know is a pirate. And if you're not a pirate, I don't know what you are.	game/hospital.rpy	1487	b "[what]"
postcupcake_0198a142	b	And I don't think you do either.	game/hospital.rpy	1488	b "[what]"
postcupcake_4403de8d	h	Yer right matey. I remember nothing before me pirate days.	game/hospital.rpy	1489	h "[what]"
postcupcake_27279cf7	h	Thanks Bert. Yer a real matey.	game/hospital.rpy	1490	h "[what]"
postcupcake_071b801b	bi	If only we knew what made Shahar this way...	game/hospital.rpy	1492	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_4c3d187c	bi	That might be an important clue. Maybe it would help him remember his past.	game/hospital.rpy	1493	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_3c43267d	bi	For now, I think this is enough.	game/hospital.rpy	1494	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_00c3d819	bi	I guess I already kind of knew when I read the records, but now I feel more sure.	game/hospital.rpy	1495	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_8c1a33ba	bi	Something... or someone, made Shahar think he was a pirate, and he was admitted here.	game/hospital.rpy	1496	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_ee310048	bi	It's nowhere near figuring out who the Game Master is, but...	game/hospital.rpy	1497	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_8152ea01	bi	It's progress.	game/hospital.rpy	1498	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_1a783c06	bi	After Shahar left, I left the kitchen.	game/hospital.rpy	1499	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_34ece8b7	bi	No one seemed to keen to talk through the window, understandably.	game/hospital.rpy	1500	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_9b4da4f0	bi	So might as well talk to Jenny with no windows involved.	game/hospital.rpy	1501	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_b86281a6	j	Hey Bert! Guess what I found?	game/hospital.rpy	1507	j "[what]"
postcupcake_dff9ab70	b	A way out?	game/hospital.rpy	1508	b "[what]"
postcupcake_1f15219e	j	Oh... no, you're gonna be disappointed if you expected that.	game/hospital.rpy	1510	j "[what]"
postcupcake_80a8b404	b	I was joking.	game/hospital.rpy	1511	b "[what]"
postcupcake_b9cdc77a_1	j	Oh.	game/hospital.rpy	1512	j "[what]"
postcupcake_4552c3cd	j	Good old Bert, always a jokester!	game/hospital.rpy	1514	j "[what]"
postcupcake_ecc95d3d	j	But no, I found a chess set!	game/hospital.rpy	1515	j "[what]"
postcupcake_a9130504	j	It was tucked under one of the couches, I guess we didn't search this room deeply enough.	game/hospital.rpy	1516	j "[what]"
postcupcake_d38fb096	j	You wanna play a round to kill some time?	game/hospital.rpy	1517	j "[what]"
postcupcake_62e4ce52	b	Yeah, I'm down.	game/hospital.rpy	1519	b "[what]"
postcupcake_dc967109	b	Feels like everything's been sad since we got here, a game would be a nice change of pace.	game/hospital.rpy	1520	b "[what]"
postcupcake_a2998b4a	bi	I'm a beast at chess, Jenny better be ready.	game/hospital.rpy	1521	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_ac2f74b9_2	bi	...	game/hospital.rpy	1524	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_92e1df66	bi	.....	game/hospital.rpy	1526	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_825a692a	bi	Hm, a few moves in she's way better than I expected.	game/hospital.rpy	1528	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_9ff7c0eb	j	Do you play much Bert?	game/hospital.rpy	1529	j "[what]"
postcupcake_270f4fe1	j	You're pretty good.	game/hospital.rpy	1530	j "[what]"
postcupcake_e3deae12	b	I used to play online in my free time in college.	game/hospital.rpy	1532	b "[what]"
postcupcake_c658893b	b	And you?	game/hospital.rpy	1533	b "[what]"
postcupcake_91a47d3f	j	Oh, I was a tournament player in high school.	game/hospital.rpy	1534	j "[what]"
postcupcake_8f36c13e	j	Everyone needs a hobby, right?	game/hospital.rpy	1535	j "[what]"
postcupcake_17ead6aa	bi	Tournament player? Jeez, maybe I'm outmatched.	game/hospital.rpy	1536	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_903ff809	b	How well did you do in tournaments?	game/hospital.rpy	1537	b "[what]"
postcupcake_36db2173	j	I made top five in the state for high schoolers.	game/hospital.rpy	1538	j "[what]"
postcupcake_8edf891c	bi	Yeah, I'm outmatched.	game/hospital.rpy	1539	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_7cacc300	bi	Let's see... should I play a safe move or try something weird?	game/hospital.rpy	1540	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_76871b51	bi	If she's better maybe she won't expect the deviation?	game/hospital.rpy	1541	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_655e8fca	bi	I stuck with the usual way this opening played out.	game/hospital.rpy	1545	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_f7ca8234	j	You're playing pretty solid for someone who doesn't go to tournaments!	game/hospital.rpy	1546	j "[what]"
postcupcake_573c175c	b	It's only the first few moves...	game/hospital.rpy	1547	b "[what]"
postcupcake_579b97e5	b	I feel like once you play enough games you know what works.	game/hospital.rpy	1548	b "[what]"
postcupcake_fdc996d6	j	Hmm, I guess that's true when we're playing something like an Italian Game.	game/hospital.rpy	1549	j "[what]"
postcupcake_b1463f1a	j	Maybe I should have chosen a more obscure opening to throw you off.	game/hospital.rpy	1550	j "[what]"
postcupcake_90657cb0	b	No please.	game/hospital.rpy	1551	b "[what]"
postcupcake_e590bb7e	bi	I moved my f-pawn forward to protect a piece.	game/hospital.rpy	1556	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_b4fa3fc0	j	...	game/hospital.rpy	1557	j "[what]"
postcupcake_98a815a1	j	Interesting...	game/hospital.rpy	1558	j "[what]"
postcupcake_272978ef	bi	Did it catch her off guard?	game/hospital.rpy	1559	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_b2884b08	j	That was an unusual move Bert, did you think it through?	game/hospital.rpy	1560	j "[what]"
postcupcake_42a5cdd8	bi	She moved a bishop in response.	game/hospital.rpy	1561	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_34a32b6a	bi	Oh...	game/hospital.rpy	1562	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_bf1140f6	bi	She had pinned my knight since the pawn wasn't in the way...	game/hospital.rpy	1563	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_872aa615	bi	And if I try to protect it she can threaten it with a pawn next turn...	game/hospital.rpy	1564	bi "[what]"
postcupcake_e3c18721	bi	Looks like I blundered.	game/hospital.rpy	1565	bi "[what]"
chess1_1676d22c	bi	We played a few more moves...	game/hospital.rpy	1568	bi "[what]"
chess1_8929d1c3	bi	Hmm, okay, it's midgame, our rook pairs are protecting each other.	game/hospital.rpy	1569	bi "[what]"
chess1_ec18e05f	bi	We both have one on the open e-file, I could force a rook trade here...	game/hospital.rpy	1570	bi "[what]"
chess1_23db2c4e	bi	Or just let them awkwardly stare at each other and make a move elsewhere.	game/hospital.rpy	1571	bi "[what]"
chess1_c697fdf9	bi	What should I do?	game/hospital.rpy	1572	bi "[what]"
chess1_94cf47de	bi	I captured her rook, and she captured mine back.	game/hospital.rpy	1575	bi "[what]"
chess1_f89160f1	bi	Okay, now let me move my knight onto the e-file.	game/hospital.rpy	1576	bi "[what]"
chess1_6b8db036	bi	...wait, her rook is on the file now and mine isn't.	game/hospital.rpy	1578	bi "[what]"
chess1_a402d782	bi	I think that trade just gave her free control of the file...	game/hospital.rpy	1579	bi "[what]"
chess1_4e39b5b1	j	Frustrated?	game/hospital.rpy	1580	j "[what]"
chess1_3f5eb2c5	b	Yeah, I don't think I should have made that trade.	game/hospital.rpy	1582	b "[what]"
chess1_124780af	j	It's a common mistake, don't worry.	game/hospital.rpy	1583	j "[what]"
chess1_b0dd7d3b	bi	Nah, I can take some space with my knight in that file.	game/hospital.rpy	1588	bi "[what]"
chess1_f11407fe	j	Ooh, that's a good move Bert.	game/hospital.rpy	1590	j "[what]"
chess1_c04146ad	j	I'll have to think about this next one...	game/hospital.rpy	1591	j "[what]"
chess1_69ecf7dd	bi	She was complimenting me, but I was still losing slightly...	game/hospital.rpy	1593	bi "[what]"
chess1_52bf6aab	bi	I guess I'm holding up okay for our respective skill levels though.	game/hospital.rpy	1594	bi "[what]"
chess2_83e68891	bi	We kept playing, slowly narrowing down to endgame...	game/hospital.rpy	1597	bi "[what]"
chess2_297c1c5f	bi	She was threatening to back rank mate.	game/hospital.rpy	1599	bi "[what]"
chess2_239e96d8	bi	...Wait.	game/hospital.rpy	1600	bi "[what]"
chess2_9d6c15d1	bi	I think I see a mating sequence.	game/hospital.rpy	1601	bi "[what]"
chess2_e8d8547d	bi	I could win this game!	game/hospital.rpy	1602	bi "[what]"
chess2_a33fec97	bi	I haven't thought this through, but I should go for it, right?	game/hospital.rpy	1603	bi "[what]"
chess2_98c83108	bi	I made a bold sacrifice to open up her king.	game/hospital.rpy	1606	bi "[what]"
chess2_7e572606	bi	Yes, it's going exactly as I planned.	game/hospital.rpy	1608	bi "[what]"
chess2_a9fc3a70	bi	Just one move and I win!	game/hospital.rpy	1609	bi "[what]"
chess2_0955b0bf	b	Aha!	game/hospital.rpy	1610	b "[what]"
chess2_9fbca821	j	Huh?	game/hospital.rpy	1611	j "[what]"
chess2_21950309	b	I won! Checkmate!	game/hospital.rpy	1612	b "[what]"
chess2_af4a0885	j	Bert... my bishop can capture your queen.	game/hospital.rpy	1614	j "[what]"
chess2_397e3bbe	j	When you moved your pawn my bishop started protecting that square.	game/hospital.rpy	1615	j "[what]"
chess2_02c1d79b	j	It was a good try though!	game/hospital.rpy	1616	j "[what]"
chess2_c7a201e1	bi	No, she's way too good a player.	game/hospital.rpy	1622	bi "[what]"
chess2_76d89983	bi	She definitely would've seen it if I could win in three moves, right?	game/hospital.rpy	1623	bi "[what]"
chess2_7a0cdb88	bi	I pushed a pawn that was next to my king, to at least last one more move...	game/hospital.rpy	1624	bi "[what]"
chess3_4ebfdc53	bi	Unfortunately, my efforts weren't enough.	game/hospital.rpy	1628	bi "[what]"

trial3b_5dfd4d8d	b	No, I don't think Shahar was struck in the forehead.	game/hospital.rpy	2617	b "[what]"

trial3b_82372663	b	It's more likely he would have fell over backwards.	game/hospital.rpy	2623	b "[what]"

trial3c2_ccb4ea30	d	But if I recall, you all returned to your cells at roughly the same time last night.	game/hospital.rpy	2719	d "[what]"
trial3c2_d23bbc19	d	The cells doors are well... not doors. You can hear and see through them easily.	game/hospital.rpy	2720	d "[what]"
trial3c2_2a03d943	d	It would have been very difficult for a patient to reach Shahar's cell during twilight...	game/hospital.rpy	2721	d "[what]"
trial3c2_0a86a962	d	At least, without being noticed by Jenny or Bert.	game/hospital.rpy	2722	d "[what]"
trial3c2_e816b561	l	That's true, but isn't the same true of me and Sam?	game/hospital.rpy	2723	l "[what]"
trial3c2_8c8f1fc5	d	No, because there was some time today everyone was in the cafeteria...	game/hospital.rpy	2724	d "[what]"
trial3c2_e3699470	d	Except for you, Sam, or Shahar.	game/hospital.rpy	2725	d "[what]"
trial3c2_100ee5c5	d	Furthermore, none of us could have seen movement on the guard side from the cafeteria.	game/hospital.rpy	2726	d "[what]"
trial3c2_8494c136	d	It would be the perfect window of opportunity to kill Shahar.	game/hospital.rpy	2727	d "[what]"
trial3c2_97a45842	l	It's true that Sam and I had a window to kill Shahar...	game/hospital.rpy	2728	l "[what]"
trial3c2_365afecb	l	But I can prove I didn't do it!	game/hospital.rpy	2729	l "[what]"
trial3d_263af500	b	Wait, according to Sam's account, Sam stared out the cell door the entire morning.	game/hospital.rpy	2746	b "[what]"
trial3d_15319927	b	From before the intercom went off, until Lauren arrived at Sam's cell.	game/hospital.rpy	2747	b "[what]"
trial3d_d820cf25	d	So? I already covered this, Lauren could have made her first appearance after the murder.	game/hospital.rpy	2748	d "[what]"
trial3d_75c60bfa	d	Sam would be none the wiser as to Lauren's activities prior to her meeting Sam this morning.	game/hospital.rpy	2749	d "[what]"
trial3d_63c5795e	b	Well, no, Sam claimed to be staring out the cell door at the guard side the entire morning.	game/hospital.rpy	2750	b "[what]"
trial3d_e99ad680	b	And Lauren's cell is at the end of hall containing Sam's cell.	game/hospital.rpy	2751	b "[what]"
trial3d_bf79d858	l	Yeah, that's true!	game/hospital.rpy	2752	l "[what]"
trial3d_16ac4c23	l	For me to leave my cell and the hallway, I'd have to pass by Sam's cell.	game/hospital.rpy	2753	l "[what]"
trial3d_ea4a91b1	l	So if I killed Shahar, Sam would've seen me walk past.	game/hospital.rpy	2754	l "[what]"
trial3d_3fb0e10f	l	Me meeting Sam at the cell would've been the second time Sam saw me this morning.	game/hospital.rpy	2755	l "[what]"
trial3d_2563fc40	s	...Yeah, that didn't happen...	game/hospital.rpy	2756	s "[what]"
trial3d_4f093895	s	...Dumb vampire...	game/hospital.rpy	2757	s "[what]"
trial3d_fbc78476	d	Hmph fine. So Lauren couldn't have left without Sam noticing...	game/hospital.rpy	2758	d "[what]"
trial3d_8f160f56	d	But that means Sam could have left without Lauren noticing.	game/hospital.rpy	2759	d "[what]"
trial3d_58958ab3	b	No, Lauren said she went to Sam's cell basically as soon as the intercom went off...	game/hospital.rpy	2760	b "[what]"
trial3d_1b3413a6	b	That would mean Sam would have to go to across the floor to Shahar's cell, kill him...	game/hospital.rpy	2761	b "[what]"
trial3d_f514df8a	b	And then return, all in the time it took Lauren to walk roughly ten feet over to Sam's cell.	game/hospital.rpy	2762	b "[what]"
trial3d_45427525	d	...Alright, I guess this case is not as clear-cut as I assumed.	game/hospital.rpy	2763	d "[what]"
trial3d_aec79060	d	Apologies for the diversion.	game/hospital.rpy	2764	d "[what]"
trial3d_5e466cfa	b	No, this was good.	game/hospital.rpy	2765	b "[what]"
trial3d_80f318f4	b	We established that Lauren and Sam couldn't have done it.	game/hospital.rpy	2766	b "[what]"
trial3d_f4cb7c32	l	But... if someone killed Shahar using the bottle, doesn't that mean Dracula or Sid did it?	game/hospital.rpy	2767	l "[what]"
trial3d_9b4f5aba	l	If Bert or Jenny did it, Dracula or Sid would have found the broken bottle yesterday.	game/hospital.rpy	2768	l "[what]"
trial3d_1c6e9e80	l	Dracula claimed earlier that Sam and I were the only ones on the guard side since we last saw Shahar...	game/hospital.rpy	2769	l "[what]"
trial3d_ea1655e8	l	But that's not necessarily true. Dracula or Sid could have killed Shahar during twilight...	game/hospital.rpy	2770	l "[what]"
trial3d_a6826768	l	After we all went to our cells, including Shahar.	game/hospital.rpy	2771	l "[what]"
trial3d_06c49ac2	d	I don't think that's a line of questioning you wish to pursue.	game/hospital.rpy	2772	d "[what]"
trial3d_938535e8	l	Why not? You'd want to say that, being the accused.	game/hospital.rpy	2773	l "[what]"
trial3d_b822c77c	d	Well, I can prove I didn't attack Shahar last night with the bottle.	game/hospital.rpy	2774	d "[what]"
trial3d_98d9d54e	d	Which would mean, according to your theory, Sid did it.	game/hospital.rpy	2775	d "[what]"
trial3d_1a8f73df	i	Hey! *cough* Screw you old man!	game/hospital.rpy	2778	i "[what]"
trial3d_fe86f45a	d	Don't direct your hatred at me. Direct it at Lauren.	game/hospital.rpy	2779	d "[what]"
trial3d_2a423ce8	d	It's her theory that places guilt onto you.	game/hospital.rpy	2780	d "[what]"
trial3d_7bbc4f28	i	You don't have proof! You're lying!	game/hospital.rpy	2781	i "[what]"
trial3d_2ea2557a	d	If I killed him yesterday during twilight, there would have been at least one witness.	game/hospital.rpy	2782	d "[what]"
trial3d_4414e326	d	Either someone who was nearby or who would have had evidence I did it.	game/hospital.rpy	2783	d "[what]"
trial3d_08bbdaee	d	Sigh... I can't deal with your incompetence any longer.	game/hospital.rpy	2784	d "[what]"
trial3d_f390889b	d	Bert, you know who I'm talking about, right?	game/hospital.rpy	2785	d "[what]"
trial3d_9915954c	d	Please explain it to the child.	game/hospital.rpy	2786	d "[what]"
trial3d_3b2c8a3d	b	Why me?	game/hospital.rpy	2787	b "[what]"
trial3d_2b42e6e7	d	So that I don't have to.	game/hospital.rpy	2788	d "[what]"
trial3d_850ef128	b	...	game/hospital.rpy	2789	b "[what]"
trial3d_e1790cc3	bi	I hate Dracula sometimes but...	game/hospital.rpy	2790	bi "[what]"
trial3d_a2c4f700	bi	If it's going to get us closer to the truth, I'll have to figure out what he's talking about.	game/hospital.rpy	2791	bi "[what]"
trial3d_97784c27	bi	Let's see, who would have been a witness to Dracula assaulting Shahar yesterday...	game/hospital.rpy	2792	bi "[what]"
trial3e_d3bb056e	b	...Sid, if Dracula killed Shahar during twilight yesterday...	game/hospital.rpy	2806	b "[what]"
trial3e_86d6baa0	b	You would have known.	game/hospital.rpy	2807	b "[what]"
trial3e_79ee1aa6	i	What?	game/hospital.rpy	2808	i "[what]"
trial3e_c0e314fd	b	Did you see any shards of glass in front of Shahar's cell when you returned to your cell last night?	game/hospital.rpy	2809	b "[what]"
trial3e_ed1853c6	i	...No.	game/hospital.rpy	2812	i "[what]"
trial3e_4f89ff66	b	So that means he didn't kill Shahar before you went to your cell yesterday.	game/hospital.rpy	2813	b "[what]"
trial3e_6ce150e8	i	Oh... but *cough* wait, he could have killed Shahar when I was in my cell!	game/hospital.rpy	2814	i "[what]"
trial3e_27a25872	b	Sure, but then he would have had to pass your cell.	game/hospital.rpy	2815	b "[what]"
trial3e_3b520a2b	i	What if I *cough* wasn't looking when he walked by?	game/hospital.rpy	2816	i "[what]"
trial3e_be3951ce	b	Well, you would have probably heard something too.	game/hospital.rpy	2817	b "[what]"
trial3e_fd95b6c0	b	Shahar's cell is next to yours, and the cell door lets sound through freely.	game/hospital.rpy	2818	b "[what]"
trial3e_f750d549	b	Not to mention, even if somehow you missed Dracula passing twice and the sound of glass breaking...	game/hospital.rpy	2819	b "[what]"
trial3e_9f8f60bc	b	Jenny and I are also in that hallway.	game/hospital.rpy	2820	b "[what]"
trial3e_0cb38c47	b	Do we really think Dracula snuck past all three of us twice, and none of us heard that sound?	game/hospital.rpy	2821	b "[what]"
trial3e_6f3d4875	i	...	game/hospital.rpy	2822	i "[what]"
trial3e_48216691	i	So... are you accusing *cough* me?	game/hospital.rpy	2825	i "[what]"
trial3e_35ba70ca	b	What?	game/hospital.rpy	2826	b "[what]"
trial3e_d362ae63	i	Well Lauren said it had to either be Dracula or I...	game/hospital.rpy	2827	i "[what]"
trial3e_e2899028	i	And you just said *cough* Dracula couldn't do it...	game/hospital.rpy	2828	i "[what]"
trial3e_8b9d1bdf	i	*cough* Seems like you're accusing me...	game/hospital.rpy	2829	i "[what]"
trial3e_4a14e8d5	i	I'm gonna die, and you're all gonna *cough* die!	game/hospital.rpy	2830	i "[what]"
trial3e_75e017b7	s	Shut up...	game/hospital.rpy	2837	s "[what]"
trial3e_79ee1aa6_1	i	What?	game/hospital.rpy	2838	i "[what]"
trial3e_8651a6be	s	That's not what Bert proved...	game/hospital.rpy	2839	s "[what]"
trial3e_c052086f	s	...All he said was you're the only one that could have hit Shahar with the bottle...	game/hospital.rpy	2840	s "[what]"
trial3e_d8bbc2c6	i	Screw you! *cough* That's just accusing me again!	game/hospital.rpy	2841	i "[what]"
trial3e_f8867fd7	b	!	game/hospital.rpy	2842	b "[what]"
trial3e_034cea47	b	Wait... Sam, that's a great point.	game/hospital.rpy	2843	b "[what]"
trial3e_7f9db12f	i	What? No *cough* it's not!	game/hospital.rpy	2844	i "[what]"
trial3e_b58afaa1	b	Sid, just listen for a second.	game/hospital.rpy	2845	b "[what]"
trial3e_8f723767	b	What Sam said is true, you're the only one that could have hit Shahar with the bottle last night.	game/hospital.rpy	2846	b "[what]"
trial3e_a3bab1b7	b	At least, without anyone seeing you do it.	game/hospital.rpy	2847	b "[what]"
trial3e_0dba9feb	b	But we don't know that the bottle was used to hit Shahar.	game/hospital.rpy	2848	b "[what]"
trial3e_75363d61	b	I kind of doubt it was, because even if Jenny and I didn't see Sid walk to Shahar's cell...	game/hospital.rpy	2849	b "[what]"
trial3e_008fb704	b	Why didn't we hear the bottle break last night?	game/hospital.rpy	2850	b "[what]"
trial3e_25919b69	d	Maybe you both fell asleep before twilight ended, and Sid did it right at the end of twilight.	game/hospital.rpy	2851	d "[what]"
trial3e_47f336e9	b	Maybe, but that's stretching a bit...	game/hospital.rpy	2852	b "[what]"
trial3e_ff9a417f	b	And that would also mean you could have done it while we were asleep.	game/hospital.rpy	2853	b "[what]"
trial3e_7386923f	b	Until we figure out what the bottle's connection to the murder is, we can't accuse anyone.	game/hospital.rpy	2854	b "[what]"
trial3e_6f3d4875_1	i	...	game/hospital.rpy	2857	i "[what]"
trial3e_0335488d	i	Oh! I get it!	game/hospital.rpy	2858	i "[what]"
trial3e_0504b467	i	I'm gonna think really hard about *cough* what the bottle's purpose is!	game/hospital.rpy	2859	i "[what]"
trial3e_6f3d4875_2	i	...	game/hospital.rpy	2860	i "[what]"
trial3e_850ef128	b	...	game/hospital.rpy	2861	b "[what]"
trial3e_43bfe1a8	i	...Okay, I got *cough* nothing.	game/hospital.rpy	2862	i "[what]"
trial3e_34c76143	d	I don't understand... how else would a bottle be used in the murder besides as a weapon?	game/hospital.rpy	2863	d "[what]"
trial3e_0a713970	l	Maybe it was just randomly there?	game/hospital.rpy	2864	l "[what]"
trial3e_a6be7b17	j	Wait... something's weird about how Lauren described the glass shards she found...	game/hospital.rpy	2868	j "[what]"
trial3e_ac9755bd	j	I think we can rule out Shahar being hit by the bottle!	game/hospital.rpy	2869	j "[what]"
trial3e_f2476671	b	Oh?	game/hospital.rpy	2870	b "[what]"
trial3e_8e4aeafa	j	Think about it, if Shahar was hit with the bottle through the cell, something is missing...	game/hospital.rpy	2873	j "[what]"
trial3e_6056273f	bi	Missing?	game/hospital.rpy	2874	bi "[what]"
trial3e_c23de5ac	bi	Let me try to visualize what Lauren described about the scene of Shahar's death...	game/hospital.rpy	2875	bi "[what]"
trial3e_b31dd52b	bi	If Shahar was hit with the bottle through the cell, what spot is missing something?	game/hospital.rpy	2876	bi "[what]"
trial3f_76196434	b	Lauren, where were all the glass shards when you found them?	game/hospital.rpy	2891	b "[what]"
trial3f_1694f1d6	l	They were all on the floor in front of Shahar's cell.	game/hospital.rpy	2892	l "[what]"
trial3f_19405186	b	So there were none inside the cell?	game/hospital.rpy	2893	b "[what]"
trial3f_cfe98c4b	l	Not that I remember, no...	game/hospital.rpy	2894	l "[what]"
trial3f_a3374894	j	Yeah, that's what I was getting at!	game/hospital.rpy	2895	j "[what]"
trial3f_7de15548	j	If someone hit Shahar with a bottle through the cell door...	game/hospital.rpy	2896	j "[what]"
trial3f_cef6e171	d	And by someone, you mean Sid.	game/hospital.rpy	2901	d "[what]"
trial3f_765f1a4e	j	...If {i}Sid{/i} hit Shahar with a bottle through the cell door.	game/hospital.rpy	2905	j "[what]"
trial3f_7361ed7a	j	That means the bottle broke inside the cell, with momentum going into the cell.	game/hospital.rpy	2906	j "[what]"
trial3f_756bb789	j	So how did all the shards end up outside the cell?	game/hospital.rpy	2907	j "[what]"
trial3f_8c0afc0a	l	Perhaps the murderer cleaned up the shards inside the cell...	game/hospital.rpy	2908	l "[what]"
trial3f_40fa7183	j	Oh, you mean to like, hide the evidence?	game/hospital.rpy	2909	j "[what]"
trial3f_3c45b10f	l	That would be the most likely reason, yeah.	game/hospital.rpy	2910	l "[what]"
trial3f_8fb25b86	b	I don't think that's it.	game/hospital.rpy	2911	b "[what]"
trial3f_1706898f	b	Because then something else is out-of-place at the murder scene...	game/hospital.rpy	2912	b "[what]"
trial3f_c896151b	bi	This one should be obvious, but I'll spell it out anyway...	game/hospital.rpy	2913	bi "[what]"
trial3f_191ae971	bi	If someone cleaned up the shards inside the cell, what doesn't make sense?	game/hospital.rpy	2914	bi "[what]"
trial3g_f49c2986	b	Dracula, if the murderer cleaned up the shards inside the cell...	game/hospital.rpy	2929	b "[what]"
trial3g_af89d24f	b	Why are there still shards outside the cell?	game/hospital.rpy	2930	b "[what]"
trial3g_ed141093	b	It makes no sense to me. A guard could have easily cleaned those as well.	game/hospital.rpy	2931	b "[what]"
trial3g_f0fcdf16	j	Oh yeah! If someone was trying to clean up the shards to hide the evidence...	game/hospital.rpy	2932	j "[what]"
trial3g_d03b9e29	j	They could have easily cleaned up the shards outside as well!	game/hospital.rpy	2933	j "[what]"
trial3g_04e29003	l	I was thinking the same thing, but...	game/hospital.rpy	2934	l "[what]"
trial3g_79b385da	l	Well, there's one possible killer who wouldn't have cleaned up the shards outside.	game/hospital.rpy	2935	l "[what]"
trial3g_a475dd4c	j	What?	game/hospital.rpy	2936	j "[what]"
trial3g_20adaaa2	l	Just think about it for a second...	game/hospital.rpy	2937	l "[what]"
trial3h_a38e9f51	b	You think... Shahar did it?	game/hospital.rpy	2952	b "[what]"
trial3h_ca71743d	b	He... he...	game/hospital.rpy	2953	b "[what]"
trial3h_d71e4e7d	bi	I couldn't bring myself to say it.	game/hospital.rpy	2954	bi "[what]"
trial3h_94bef8c0	bi	The words "killed himself."	game/hospital.rpy	2955	bi "[what]"
trial3h_4ef2a2c8	l	I mean... it would explain why the shards outside the cell couldn't be cleaned.	game/hospital.rpy	2956	l "[what]"
trial3h_42f46e26	l	Shahar wasn't allowed to leave his cell on the guard side.	game/hospital.rpy	2957	l "[what]"
trial3h_11957eaa	l	So he could move shards from inside his cell to outside, but not move them from there.	game/hospital.rpy	2958	l "[what]"
trial3h_727b7864	b	But... why?	game/hospital.rpy	2959	b "[what]"
trial3h_bce12951	j	Why what?	game/hospital.rpy	2960	j "[what]"
trial3h_9f72c8b3	b	Why would he do that?	game/hospital.rpy	2961	b "[what]"
trial3h_09f8991b	j	My guess is he moved the shards to conceal the nature of how he di-	game/hospital.rpy	2962	j "[what]"
trial3h_519284ca	l	I think Bert meant why would he commit suicide.	game/hospital.rpy	2963	l "[what]"
trial3h_bd832657	j	...Oh.	game/hospital.rpy	2964	j "[what]"
trial3h_9a0ec5c6	b	Yeah, that...	game/hospital.rpy	2965	b "[what]"
trial3h_9ec2c211	bi	As usual, Lauren not afraid to do what I can't...	game/hospital.rpy	2966	bi "[what]"
trial3h_8aee85d4	b	It's just... why would you waste your shot at stopping the Game Master?	game/hospital.rpy	2967	b "[what]"
trial3h_7e693496	b	And potentially risk everyone else's lives in the process?	game/hospital.rpy	2968	b "[what]"
trial3h_7da52106	l	Did Shahar have any reason to... well, have a negative outlook on life?	game/hospital.rpy	2969	l "[what]"
trial3h_6aa491a7	l	People can make... well, irrational decisions when they're pushed to the edge.	game/hospital.rpy	2970	l "[what]"
trial3h_0bbd503d	bi	...I don't want to, but... I have to tell them.	game/hospital.rpy	2971	bi "[what]"
trial3h_4b18fc42	b	...Yeah, I think Shahar had a reason.	game/hospital.rpy	2972	b "[what]"
trial3h_8b5330ef	b	I hid some information from the rest of you.	game/hospital.rpy	2973	b "[what]"
trial3h_9c357fda	b	Remember how I said the computer has some patient records?	game/hospital.rpy	2974	b "[what]"
trial3h_db6e730d	b	When I first checked it out I lied when I said I didn't recognize any of the names.	game/hospital.rpy	2975	b "[what]"
trial3h_91cf06b1	b	Shahar's name was in there. And the only thing on his record was...	game/hospital.rpy	2976	b "[what]"
trial3h_abec9869	b	"Patient thinks he is a pirate".	game/hospital.rpy	2977	b "[what]"
trial3h_a07cd3bd	l	Why didn't you tell us?	game/hospital.rpy	2978	l "[what]"
trial3h_3f85ecc3	b	I... I thought given what we learned about Catherine and the mansion...	game/hospital.rpy	2979	b "[what]"
trial3h_51cb2816	b	People might wrongly accuse him of being the Game Master.	game/hospital.rpy	2980	b "[what]"
trial3h_2315a8f0	b	It might get him killed and waste an opportunity to get out of here.	game/hospital.rpy	2981	b "[what]"
trial3h_41c99d51	i	But how did you know he wasn't the Game Master?	game/hospital.rpy	2982	i "[what]"
trial3h_30495170	b	I didn't.	game/hospital.rpy	2983	b "[what]"
trial3h_2d04e42d	b	But I thought there was no way the Game Master would leave such an obvious clue.	game/hospital.rpy	2984	b "[what]"
trial3h_f8550e51	b	And I felt bad for him. If he really thinks he's a pirate and it's not all an act...	game/hospital.rpy	2985	b "[what]"
trial3h_23de66d2	l	That's... understandable.	game/hospital.rpy	2986	l "[what]"
trial3h_f7d55d9c	l	Regardless, you told us now when it mattered.	game/hospital.rpy	2987	l "[what]"
trial3h_ebed95f2	l	And it explains why Shahar may have taken such extreme actions.	game/hospital.rpy	2988	l "[what]"

trial3i_1f36b93f	b	I want to figure out what's causing it...	game/hospital.rpy	3073	b "[what]"
trial3k_dabdef40	b	If you look at the order of the cells...	game/hospital.rpy	3097	b "[what]"
trial3k_c94257cf	b	Sid's cell is neighboring Shahar's, and it's the only one neighboring Shahar.	game/hospital.rpy	3098	b "[what]"
trial3k_ab0cb4cc	b	It's possible whatever the cause of Sid's cough is was something tied to Shahar's death.	game/hospital.rpy	3099	b "[what]"
trial3k_c0597c35	b	And Sid was caught in the crossfire.	game/hospital.rpy	3100	b "[what]"
trial3k_80f2cc1a	j	You think Sid is coughing because a bullet meant for Shahar hit Sid?	game/hospital.rpy	3101	j "[what]"
trial3k_8a0ebf01	b	Um... it's an expression.	game/hospital.rpy	3102	b "[what]"
trial3k_dfc34bcf	b	Basically, Sid was an accidental victim of whatever killed Shahar.	game/hospital.rpy	3103	b "[what]"
trial3k_01a68ee9	j	But Bert, your cell is the next-closest to Shahar.	game/hospital.rpy	3104	j "[what]"
trial3k_423d2971	j	And you seem to be unaffected.	game/hospital.rpy	3105	j "[what]"
trial3k_0e1f0a54	b	That's not quite true...	game/hospital.rpy	3106	b "[what]"
trial3k_d41e95b4	b	This morning I had a tingling in my throat.	game/hospital.rpy	3107	b "[what]"
trial3k_341169eb	b	It was like the beginning of a sore throat.	game/hospital.rpy	3108	b "[what]"
trial3k_8a450412	b	I didn't think much of it, but...	game/hospital.rpy	3109	b "[what]"
trial3k_a77c7b2c	b	It might also be caused by the same thing.	game/hospital.rpy	3110	b "[what]"
trial3k_22e77f7b	d	You could just be making that up to support your theory.	game/hospital.rpy	3111	d "[what]"
trial3k_faa723f9	b	Unless I'm the killer, there's really no reason for me to do that...	game/hospital.rpy	3112	b "[what]"
trial3k_38e5348a	b	Sid said his cough started last night, but has only been getting better since.	game/hospital.rpy	3115	b "[what]"
trial3k_961791d7	b	And I don't think Sid was feeling sick at all yesterday.	game/hospital.rpy	3116	b "[what]"
trial3k_cbbfee87	i	No, I wasn't... I felt perfectly healthy.	game/hospital.rpy	3117	i "[what]"
trial3k_f6a759fd	b	So whatever caused Sid's cough probably happened last night.	game/hospital.rpy	3118	b "[what]"
trial3k_757dc3de	b	Which, incidentally, is when Shahar likely died.	game/hospital.rpy	3119	b "[what]"
trial3k_2f1d25d7	b	This would easily be explained if the cause of Shahar's death was also the cause of Sid's cough.	game/hospital.rpy	3120	b "[what]"
trial3k_e714e4da	d	Hm, I'm not fully convinced. This could just be a coincidence.	game/hospital.rpy	3122	d "[what]"
trial3k_c125b3e0	d	Without more evidence connecting the two events, I still think they're unrelated.	game/hospital.rpy	3123	d "[what]"
trial3k_42aaa12d	b	Well, that's the not the only thing...	game/hospital.rpy	3124	b "[what]"
trial3k_76f3263f	b	There's one more reason I think Sid's cough could be related to Shahar's death...	game/hospital.rpy	3125	b "[what]"
trial3k_d48e6903	l	Okay, I thought you weren't serious before but...	game/hospital.rpy	3131	l "[what]"
trial3k_6d5e4de5	l	I think you're onto something.	game/hospital.rpy	3132	l "[what]"
trial3k_e7ded5c2	l	But I still feel like we're at a dead end...	game/hospital.rpy	3133	l "[what]"
trial3k_cc668fc2	b	What? Why? We just made a big leap, I think...	game/hospital.rpy	3134	b "[what]"
trial3k_623924c7	l	Well, even if we know that Sid's cough and Shahar's death share a cause...	game/hospital.rpy	3135	l "[what]"
trial3k_45e8de2c	l	We don't know what the cause is.	game/hospital.rpy	3136	l "[what]"
trial3k_232952f2	b	Maybe not right now, but we can narrow it down based on our hypotheses.	game/hospital.rpy	3137	b "[what]"
trial3k_1a8a8b4b	b	It had to be able to affect Sid somehow.	game/hospital.rpy	3138	b "[what]"
trial3k_d5588d87	b	And from the earlier conversation, we think it also had to be related to the bottle.	game/hospital.rpy	3139	b "[what]"
trial3l_e0bb7dcc	b	Given that, I think what most likely killed Shahar was...	game/hospital.rpy	3142	b "[what]" nointeract
trial3l_b3f1a894	bi	I don't see how an intact bottle would have affected Sid...	game/hospital.rpy	3145	bi "[what]"
trial3l_f3b32f59	bi	Much less made him start coughing.	game/hospital.rpy	3146	bi "[what]"
trial3l_f95237f2	bi	The shards were only found in front of Shahar's cell...	game/hospital.rpy	3148	bi "[what]"
trial3l_830d0afb	bi	I don't know how they'd affect Sid or make him start coughing.	game/hospital.rpy	3149	bi "[what]"
trial3l_1b9e4326	bi	Yeah, that's it!	game/hospital.rpy	3152	bi "[what]"
trial3l_ac76c140	bi	How is the bottle related?	game/hospital.rpy	3154	bi "[what]"
trial3l_92e48c63	b	The only thing that makes sense is the bottle had something in it that killed Shahar.	game/hospital.rpy	3156	b "[what]"
trial3l_e98f8422	b	All the pieces of the bottle we found were in front of Shahar's cell.	game/hospital.rpy	3157	b "[what]"
trial3l_75b16140	b	And based on our earlier discussion, the bottle itself didn't kill Shahar.	game/hospital.rpy	3158	b "[what]"
trial3l_9cfff252	b	But whatever was in the bottle is unaccounted for.	game/hospital.rpy	3159	b "[what]"
trial3l_a37baa70	b	The bottle shards couldn't have moved, but the contents of the bottle could have.	game/hospital.rpy	3160	b "[what]"
trial3l_54f33070	b	If it's something that could have spread around, then it could have reached Sid.	game/hospital.rpy	3161	b "[what]"
trial3l_7ee5b157	l	You think it poisoned Shahar somehow?	game/hospital.rpy	3162	l "[what]"
trial3l_2993e132	b	Maybe...	game/hospital.rpy	3163	b "[what]"
trial3l_6bb3b11b	l	And maybe Sid somehow got poisoned too?	game/hospital.rpy	3164	l "[what]"
trial3l_50ca72a0	i	This seems like a bit of a stretch...	game/hospital.rpy	3165	i "[what]"
trial3l_7ad6c611	i	*cough* Not to mention, wasn't the bottle empty when it broke?	game/hospital.rpy	3166	i "[what]"
trial3l_0e82cf86	b	Why do you say that?	game/hospital.rpy	3167	b "[what]"
trial3l_dd2884ac	i	If the bottle had something inside *cough* wouldn't Lauren or Sam have found evidence of it?	game/hospital.rpy	3168	i "[what]"
trial3l_27560787	b	Evidence?	game/hospital.rpy	3169	b "[what]"
trial3l_09b42485	i	Like... *cough* the floor would've been wet, or stained, or it would have smelled bad.	game/hospital.rpy	3170	i "[what]"
trial3l_5a89eab6	l	I mean... I didn't exactly bother to sniff the floor when I was there...	game/hospital.rpy	3171	l "[what]"
trial3l_aed67027	l	Because, well, it would have smelled like blood.	game/hospital.rpy	3172	l "[what]"
trial3l_5a7a4330	i	Oh, *cough*, I guess that's true...	game/hospital.rpy	3173	i "[what]"
trial3l_846facfa	i	But still, there should have been some *cough* sign of something being spilled.	game/hospital.rpy	3174	i "[what]"
trial3l_13d2348e	b	Hm... that is a good point.	game/hospital.rpy	3175	b "[what]"
trial3l_693b521d	b	But I don't think that completely rules this theory out, as long as we can find an explanation.	game/hospital.rpy	3176	b "[what]"
trial3m_9f0f2e6b	b	Let me think, how could the contents of the liquid have disappeared...	game/hospital.rpy	3179	b "[what]" nointeract
trial3m_f3c6e3cb	bi	It's a weird way to phrase it, but...	game/hospital.rpy	3182	bi "[what]"
trial3m_3dfb613e	bi	No, if someone cleaned them up, they could have cleaned up the bottle too...	game/hospital.rpy	3184	bi "[what]"
trial3m_01ab11f0	bi	They could have been clear but...	game/hospital.rpy	3187	bi "[what]"
trial3m_a5840eea	bi	Wouldn't they still leave a puddle or make the floor damp?	game/hospital.rpy	3188	bi "[what]"
trial3m_b4b904e4	bi	That could explain it if it were poisoned, but then why is Sid coughing?	game/hospital.rpy	3191	bi "[what]"
trial3m_e654ba60	b	What if the contents vaporized?	game/hospital.rpy	3193	b "[what]"
trial3m_b44e1f5c	j	Vaporized?	game/hospital.rpy	3194	j "[what]"
trial3m_0d4bdbb3	b	Yeah, what if when they left the bottle they turned into gas?	game/hospital.rpy	3195	b "[what]"
trial3m_5cbae811	b	And that's why there was no trace of them.	game/hospital.rpy	3196	b "[what]"
trial3m_f1785884	b	It would also explain how they spread to Sid.	game/hospital.rpy	3197	b "[what]"
trial3m_78882948	b	Gas naturally spreads out, so if they created some sort of gas...	game/hospital.rpy	3198	b "[what]"
trial3m_0351ca1c	b	It would have spread to Sid's cell.	game/hospital.rpy	3199	b "[what]"
trial3m_9dcaedb1	b	But because gases become less concentrated as they spread out, Sid got a smaller dose than Shahar.	game/hospital.rpy	3200	b "[what]"
trial3m_1ec38883	b	And I got an smaller dose than Sid, and Jenny an even smaller dose, since the gases would have spread out further.	game/hospital.rpy	3201	b "[what]"
trial3m_4e503465	b	That would explain why Shahar died, Sid is sick, I was barely affected, and Jenny wasn't.	game/hospital.rpy	3202	b "[what]"
trial3m_dda9d9ef	d	This isn't a very scientific theory.	game/hospital.rpy	3206	d "[what]"
trial3m_dd73cd26	d	Why would the contents of the bottle suddenly vaporize when they left the bottle?	game/hospital.rpy	3207	d "[what]"
trial3m_a9c33ae3	j	Perhaps they were already a gas when they were in the bottle?	game/hospital.rpy	3208	j "[what]"
trial3m_effa47c3	d	That seems highly unlikely.	game/hospital.rpy	3209	d "[what]"
trial3m_0adfb3fb	d	Lauren did not describe finding anything like a bottle cap or plastic seal.	game/hospital.rpy	3210	d "[what]"
trial3m_5d74eeff	d	So before the bottle broke, it was still open.	game/hospital.rpy	3211	d "[what]"
trial3m_e39b3e6d	d	Remember, we're operating under the assumption that the bottle broke after last night.	game/hospital.rpy	3212	d "[what]"
trial3m_a0ce0688	d	Since otherwise Sid would have found the shards...	game/hospital.rpy	3213	d "[what]"
trial3m_463ee223	d	Or the murderer would have come back and clean them up.	game/hospital.rpy	3214	d "[what]"

trial3m_3d46a3c6	bi	Damn, we were so close too.	game/hospital.rpy	3216	bi "[what]"
trial3m_a989402b	bi	I thought we had a good theory for how Shahar died, but...	game/hospital.rpy	3217	bi "[what]"
trial3m_d9cc0ef5	l	Maybe if we can figure out what was in the bottle, it would help us figure out how it vaporized.	game/hospital.rpy	3218	l "[what]"
trial3m_1b42d2b3	d	Hmph. That's obvious.	game/hospital.rpy	3219	d "[what]"

trial3n_d9ebd798	b	The cleaning supplies?	game/hospital.rpy	3239	b "[what]"
trial3n_035d658e	l	Ammonia, bleach, ethanol, and hydrogen peroxide.	game/hospital.rpy	3240	l "[what]"

trial3n_ff1ae7fe	l	But when I looked at the glass shards, I thought something was off.	game/hospital.rpy	3258	l "[what]"
trial3n_a694f2f2	b	Off?	game/hospital.rpy	3259	b "[what]"
trial3n_dfab5124	l	Yeah, something about the shards didn't make sense.	game/hospital.rpy	3260	l "[what]"
trial3n_2a1fb172	l	Specifically...	game/hospital.rpy	3261	l "[what]"
trial3o_0e3c7f9d	l	If you look at the glass shards...	game/hospital.rpy	3276	l "[what]"
trial3o_26d49727	l	Two different shards look like the neck of a bottle.	game/hospital.rpy	3280	l "[what]"
trial3o_93cea490	l	Which means...	game/hospital.rpy	3281	l "[what]"
trial3o_7f813a37	b	Two bottles actually broke, not one.	game/hospital.rpy	3283	b "[what]"
trial3o_95416c70	j	That or the killer found a bottle that has two necks for some reason!	game/hospital.rpy	3284	j "[what]"
trial3o_ab1c15d6	l	...I don't think that's very likely.	game/hospital.rpy	3285	l "[what]"
trial3o_b3b49b9b	l	Anyway, based on this information and our current theory, this is what I think happened.	game/hospital.rpy	3286	l "[what]"
trial3o_df66446b	l	There was a bottle of ammonia, and a bottle of bleach.	game/hospital.rpy	3287	l "[what]"
trial3o_3a9880bb	l	Somehow, both broke at the same time.	game/hospital.rpy	3288	l "[what]"
trial3o_7f5bb1f2	l	When both broke, the ammonia and bleach were no longer isolated in their own bottles.	game/hospital.rpy	3289	l "[what]"
trial3o_282ad5c5	l	So they mixed and reacted to form the chloranime gas.	game/hospital.rpy	3290	l "[what]"
trial3o_90556dcd	d	Chloramine, not chloranime.	game/hospital.rpy	3291	d "[what]"
trial3o_f6016f67	l	Whatever. The point is, they formed a deadly gas.	game/hospital.rpy	3292	l "[what]"
trial3o_a810a05b	l	And that's how the gas formed only at the moment the bottle broke.	game/hospital.rpy	3293	l "[what]"
trial3o_fa24cfd2	l	In fact, there's a very easy way to check if this could have been what happened...	game/hospital.rpy	3294	l "[what]"
trial3o_ee317139	b	Uh... where did she go?	game/hospital.rpy	3296	b "[what]"
trial3o_c60ac5fe	j	I'm sure she'll be back soon!	game/hospital.rpy	3297	j "[what]"
trial3o_3cbeaf3e	d	Or she's busy hiding evidence she just thought about...	game/hospital.rpy	3298	d "[what]"
trial3o_aec642d5	s	...Shut up Dracula.	game/hospital.rpy	3299	s "[what]"
trial3o_bcefeb6b	d	That was rather rude.	game/hospital.rpy	3300	d "[what]"
trial3o_25a3132c	s	...Whatever.	game/hospital.rpy	3301	s "[what]"
trial3o_55d04366	s	...Lauren's... a good person.	game/hospital.rpy	3302	s "[what]"
trial3o_37dc80eb	s	...She's trying to save us all. If not for her we'd all be dead.	game/hospital.rpy	3303	s "[what]"
trial3o_6e5ba2fa	s	...You still suggesting it could be her is a dick move.	game/hospital.rpy	3304	s "[what]"
trial3o_7d1043fe	d	Hmph. There are no dick moves when ignoring a possibility could get us all killed.	game/hospital.rpy	3305	d "[what]"
trial3o_25a3132c_1	s	...Whatever.	game/hospital.rpy	3306	s "[what]"
trial3o_2736bb66	bi	Huh. Sam is... back to being kind of feisty now.	game/hospital.rpy	3307	bi "[what]"
trial3o_2b9d809c	bi	Well, as feisty as one can be while talking quietly and slowly.	game/hospital.rpy	3308	bi "[what]"
trial3o_31ee3611	bi	And not in an angsty way.	game/hospital.rpy	3309	bi "[what]"
trial3o_89f75c77	l	I checked the bottles of cleaning supplies in the closet.	game/hospital.rpy	3312	l "[what]"
trial3o_029a938e	l	Sure enough, the ethanol and hydrogen peroxide bottles are both full.	game/hospital.rpy	3313	l "[what]"
trial3o_e9c74794	l	But the ammonia and bleach bottles are missing some.	game/hospital.rpy	3314	l "[what]"
trial3o_b91afeb5	l	I can't really check how much they're missing, but-	game/hospital.rpy	3315	l "[what]"
trial3o_4b0eb90c	b	It's probably reasonable to assume all the bottles were full when we came.	game/hospital.rpy	3316	b "[what]"
trial3o_c20dfddc	b	Based on the ethanol and hydrogen peroxide bottles being full.	game/hospital.rpy	3317	b "[what]"
trial3o_983d9105	b	So it's likely someone removed some at some point.	game/hospital.rpy	3318	b "[what]"
trial3o_a50ba6ef	j	Are we sure no one used them to do any cleaning?	game/hospital.rpy	3319	j "[what]"
trial3o_842e3fca	bi	I looked around at Jenny, Dracula, and Sid...	game/hospital.rpy	3320	bi "[what]"
trial3o_9bf3eb53	bi	The other three guards.	game/hospital.rpy	3321	bi "[what]"
trial3o_60b23fab	bi	None of them were claiming anything.	game/hospital.rpy	3322	bi "[what]"
trial3o_9eade50c	bi	I also glanced at Lauren... she was giving me a bit of a glare.	game/hospital.rpy	3323	bi "[what]"
trial3o_e33fa838	bi	...Is she mad I spoke over her?	game/hospital.rpy	3324	bi "[what]"
trial3o_2de9f4cf	j	Huh, I thought for sure someone would lie and say they did!	game/hospital.rpy	3325	j "[what]"
trial3o_9bf4f3eb	s	...I think if someone claims to have used them...	game/hospital.rpy	3326	s "[what]"
trial3o_1107a107	s	...It makes them look suspicious...	game/hospital.rpy	3327	s "[what]"
trial3o_0626a61d	s	...Since no one mentioned using them before...	game/hospital.rpy	3328	s "[what]"
trial3o_8e58ae2a	j	Okay, so we figured out how Shahar died!	game/hospital.rpy	3329	j "[what]"
trial3o_8fbb9002	j	...Now what?	game/hospital.rpy	3330	j "[what]"
trial3o_1043e735	b	Huh?	game/hospital.rpy	3331	b "[what]"
trial3o_e357a6c7	j	I mean...	game/hospital.rpy	3332	j "[what]"
trial3o_d6e0f27b	j	The goal isn't to figure out how Shahar died.	game/hospital.rpy	3333	j "[what]"
trial3o_d19adb75	j	The goal is to figure out who did it.	game/hospital.rpy	3334	j "[what]"
trial3o_38e969cd	j	I think anyone who was a guard could have done this.	game/hospital.rpy	3335	j "[what]"
trial3o_6b89f563	j	Well, except for Lauren and Sam.	game/hospital.rpy	3336	j "[what]"
trial3o_e6902732	l	That's true...	game/hospital.rpy	3337	l "[what]"
trial3o_238b6a67	l	Anyone could have set this up.	game/hospital.rpy	3338	l "[what]"
trial3o_644d189c	d	Anyone?	game/hospital.rpy	3339	d "[what]"
trial3o_8d67487b	d	I disagree.	game/hospital.rpy	3340	d "[what]"
trial3o_885c0f3c	d	I think this just establishes that Sid did it.	game/hospital.rpy	3341	d "[what]"
trial3o_717f07c5	i	What? I told you *cough* it wasn't me?	game/hospital.rpy	3345	i "[what]"
trial3o_557453e0	i	What's the deal with trying to *cough* pin it on me?	game/hospital.rpy	3346	i "[what]"
trial3o_896aecb1	i	Did you not like my *cough* cooking or something?	game/hospital.rpy	3347	i "[what]"
trial3o_8647a1b2	i	My simple upbringing is no reason to try to *cough* get me killed!	game/hospital.rpy	3348	i "[what]"
trial3o_054c68db	d	Quiet, urchin. Let me finish speaking, then you can respond.	game/hospital.rpy	3349	d "[what]"
trial3o_bfd2f581	bi	Urchin?	game/hospital.rpy	3350	bi "[what]"
trial3o_602923f9	i	Urchin?!?!	game/hospital.rpy	3351	i "[what]"
trial3o_81452530	d	I said, let me finish speaking.	game/hospital.rpy	3352	d "[what]"
trial3p_644b9ce6	i	Yeah, old man, you're wrong!	game/hospital.rpy	3372	i "[what]"
trial3p_6f3d4875	i	...	game/hospital.rpy	3373	i "[what]"
trial3p_1a181084	i	Wait, I don't *cough* get it.	game/hospital.rpy	3376	i "[what]"
trial3p_5dc5439c	b	The claim is that there was nowhere to hide the bottles.	game/hospital.rpy	3377	b "[what]"
trial3p_f8633f95	b	If that were true, then yes, Sid would be the only possible culprit.	game/hospital.rpy	3378	b "[what]"
trial3p_238d6c25	b	Otherwise he would have seen the bottles on the way to bed.	game/hospital.rpy	3379	b "[what]"
trial3p_4547bc31	i	Grrr... I don't like how you're *cough* wording this, Bert!	game/hospital.rpy	3382	i "[what]"
trial3p_86a790c2	b	Hold on Sid.	game/hospital.rpy	3383	b "[what]"
trial3p_7abc3a8e	b	The thing is, there is somewhere in the hallway where one could hide the bottles.	game/hospital.rpy	3384	b "[what]"
trial3p_db361c6a	b	On top of the pipes.	game/hospital.rpy	3388	b "[what]"
trial3p_133fd3af	b	If the bottles sat directly on top of the pipe, they'd be easy to miss.	game/hospital.rpy	3389	b "[what]"
trial3p_18c84543	b	You'd have to look up at the ceiling, and even then you'd have to be not directly below the pipes.	game/hospital.rpy	3390	b "[what]"
trial3p_33c4cf70	b	Otherwise, they might not be visible.	game/hospital.rpy	3391	b "[what]"
trial3p_2eff232b	b	So I think we can't immediately conclude that Sid did it.	game/hospital.rpy	3392	b "[what]"
trial3p_51b95e25	i	Oh. That makes sense.	game/hospital.rpy	3396	i "[what]"
trial3p_5e1e0590	i	Sorry Bert, I shouldn't have interrupted you.	game/hospital.rpy	3397	i "[what]"
trial3p_452cd8f2	l	But if that's true, then we still don't know if you, Jenny, Dracula, or Sid did it...	game/hospital.rpy	3398	l "[what]"
trial3p_6adb9969	d	Also, I think that is a bit too simplistic an answer.	game/hospital.rpy	3399	d "[what]"
trial3p_e7093d2b	bi	...This is it, Bert.	game/hospital.rpy	3402	bi "[what]"
trial3p_54b4cb46	bi	We're nearing the end.	game/hospital.rpy	3403	bi "[what]"
trial3p_9d16d8df	bi	I can feel it.	game/hospital.rpy	3404	bi "[what]"
trial3p_552996de	bi	We're on the right path.	game/hospital.rpy	3405	bi "[what]"
trial3p_81e83e00	bi	Just one more train of thought to resolve, and I think we'll have done it again.	game/hospital.rpy	3406	bi "[what]"
trial3p_f909ccc3	bi	The rest of the pieces fall into place on their own.	game/hospital.rpy	3407	bi "[what]"
trial3p_6aa03781	b	Tell me Dracula.	game/hospital.rpy	3409	b "[what]"
trial3p_5a1644e3	b	Why is it too simplistic?	game/hospital.rpy	3410	b "[what]"
trial3p_c183bde8	d	The pipes are circular.	game/hospital.rpy	3414	d "[what]"
trial3p_4f076d3e	d	You can look in the patient hallway if you don't believe me, they're the same on both sides.	game/hospital.rpy	3415	d "[what]"
trial3p_da703050	d	Lauren can confirm, if you still don't believe me.	game/hospital.rpy	3416	d "[what]"
trial3p_f9029cf6	l	He's right, the pipes are circular... as most pipes are.	game/hospital.rpy	3417	l "[what]"
trial3p_c3055bbd	i	Why does that matter?	game/hospital.rpy	3418	i "[what]"
trial3p_3ae23980	d	Sigh... I get that to some of you I seem dismissive but you must understand...	game/hospital.rpy	3419	d "[what]"
trial3p_0ee61b8b	d	If you think about this even for a second, the issue is obvious.	game/hospital.rpy	3420	d "[what]"
trial3q_9d8567b1	b	Dracula's right...	game/hospital.rpy	3440	b "[what]"
trial3q_d6790311	b	The killer would need some way to hold the bottle in place on top of the pipe, to make sure it didn't fall off immediately.	game/hospital.rpy	3441	b "[what]"
trial3q_7874dd9b	b	There's no other way to keep the bottle up there for more than a few seconds.	game/hospital.rpy	3442	b "[what]"
trial3q_9d3bcccb	i	So... the bottles weren't hidden on the pipe?	game/hospital.rpy	3443	i "[what]"
trial3q_da2ac678	i	Screw you Bert! How many times *cough* are you going to accuse me of being the killer!	game/hospital.rpy	3446	i "[what]"
trial3q_78926e48	l	Sid... you need to let Bert finish explaining himself.	game/hospital.rpy	3447	l "[what]"
trial3q_a658af0a	l	Every time you've been angry at him, when he finished talking you weren't angry anymore.	game/hospital.rpy	3448	l "[what]"
trial3q_6f3d4875	i	...	game/hospital.rpy	3449	i "[what]"
trial3q_885abfdf	i	Sorry, it's just... a lot of pressure being accused constantly by people like Dracula.	game/hospital.rpy	3452	i "[what]"
trial3q_e588b156	d	"People like Dracula?"	game/hospital.rpy	3453	d "[what]"
trial3q_ed9bb00e	i	First my parents, then Dan, and now Shahar's cell being next to mine...	game/hospital.rpy	3454	i "[what]"
trial3q_09b54f71	i	I feel like I'm a bad luck charm.	game/hospital.rpy	3455	i "[what]"
trial3q_f107e6b4	bi	Man, is it annoying having to soothe him every time I try to explain something.	game/hospital.rpy	3456	bi "[what]"
trial3q_0ab33bf6	b	Anyway, as I was saying...	game/hospital.rpy	3457	b "[what]"
trial3q_0b71ce6a	b	The killer would need a way to hold the bottle in place, but who says such a way doesn't exist?	game/hospital.rpy	3458	b "[what]"
trial3q_c8409ec5	b	Thinking about the list of evidence Lauren found, it's pretty obvious what it is...	game/hospital.rpy	3459	b "[what]"
trial3r_830449ab	b	The "medical glue" in the first aid kit.	game/hospital.rpy	3474	b "[what]"
trial3r_6fd5966e	i	Wait... there's a first aid kit?	game/hospital.rpy	3475	i "[what]"
trial3r_6c14e320	i	Why didn't anyone get me medication for my sore throat?	game/hospital.rpy	3476	i "[what]"
trial3r_3bdb45b9	b	Um... Sid, we found Shahar dead this morning, remember?	game/hospital.rpy	3477	b "[what]"
trial3r_50ac5d80	b	We've kind of been busy with that...	game/hospital.rpy	3478	b "[what]"
trial3r_ed88fdb5	l	Sorry Sid, I should have grabbed you something while investigating.	game/hospital.rpy	3479	l "[what]"
trial3r_bd7d417d	l	I'll go see if there's anything in there you can use.	game/hospital.rpy	3480	l "[what]"
trial3r_1bdab508	bi	Lauren has much more patience than I do.	game/hospital.rpy	3484	bi "[what]"
trial3r_16b3dde5	bi	On the one hand I find that admirable, on the other hand...	game/hospital.rpy	3485	bi "[what]"
trial3r_2b849e5e	bi	If I had that much patience, I might have to be the one dealing with Sid.	game/hospital.rpy	3486	bi "[what]"
trial3r_6f91ee70	bi	No thank you.	game/hospital.rpy	3487	bi "[what]"
trial3r_629c61c6	s	...Aren't there other things in the first aid kit?	game/hospital.rpy	3488	s "[what]"
trial3r_6560682f	s	...We saw bandages, aren't those an adhesive too?	game/hospital.rpy	3489	s "[what]"
trial3r_ae5518e4	b	That's true, but there's a few reasons to believe the medical glue was used but not the bandages.	game/hospital.rpy	3490	b "[what]"
trial3s_76efd12f	b	The main reason being...	game/hospital.rpy	3493	b "[what]" nointeract
trial3s_a6cf2205	bi	That's it!	game/hospital.rpy	3496	bi "[what]"
trial3s_113994e4	bi	Yeah! Bandages use a weak adhesive!	game/hospital.rpy	3498	bi "[what]"
trial3s_22355ef7	bi	That's why it doesn't hurt to rip them off!	game/hospital.rpy	3499	bi "[what]"
trial3s_9135f127	bi	...Wait, no it definitely hurts.	game/hospital.rpy	3500	bi "[what]"
trial3s_48359193	bi	Also, if one bandage wasn't strong enough, you could always use more...	game/hospital.rpy	3501	bi "[what]"
trial3s_6a076ebe	bi	That's not a very satisfactory explanation.	game/hospital.rpy	3502	bi "[what]"
trial3s_2ba13544	bi	What do the contents of the bottle have to do with anything?	game/hospital.rpy	3505	bi "[what]"
trial3s_166eded4	bi	The adhesive would only have touched the bottle itself...	game/hospital.rpy	3506	bi "[what]"
trial3s_2ab03189	bi	I think most people have used a bandage at least once in their life.	game/hospital.rpy	3509	bi "[what]"
trial3s_ddfcebd1	bi	Really, I would have chosen the bandages over the medical glue if ease of use were the only concern.	game/hospital.rpy	3510	bi "[what]"
trial3s_f6900fed	b	Lauren said that nothing in first aid kit actually looked like it had been used...	game/hospital.rpy	3512	b "[what]"
trial3s_a8ac6ea0	b	Except for the medical glue.	game/hospital.rpy	3513	b "[what]"
trial3s_ae7bb6a4	b	Lauren said there was a bit of residue on the bottle.	game/hospital.rpy	3514	b "[what]"
trial3s_fc4690c7	b	Besides the first aid kit, I can't think of any other adhesives in this place.	game/hospital.rpy	3515	b "[what]"
trial3s_b5e7e32c	b	So I think if the killer used an adhesive, it had to-{p=0.5}{nw}	game/hospital.rpy	3516	b "[what]"
trial3s_55ae77dc	l	Hey Sid, there's not really any cough drops or anything like that in here.	game/hospital.rpy	3521	l "[what]"
trial3s_a67e78de	l	The only things that might help are some generic over-the-counter medicine.	game/hospital.rpy	3522	l "[what]"
trial3s_04196ea3	l	Let me pour you a cup of water, and then you can use whichever you want.	game/hospital.rpy	3523	l "[what]"
trial3s_7adb3fe3	i	Thanks Lauren!	game/hospital.rpy	3524	i "[what]"
trial3s_e0ad954a	b	...As I was saying, it had to-{p=0.5}{nw}	game/hospital.rpy	3525	b "[what]"
trial3s_d7b2f126	i	*Swish swish swish*	game/hospital.rpy	3526	i "[what]"
trial3s_4ce4cdf9	b	...Do you have to swish water in order to take pills?	game/hospital.rpy	3527	b "[what]"
trial3s_86113db2	i	It's a habit I built...	game/hospital.rpy	3528	i "[what]"
trial3s_8feb666d	i	It helps to get crumbs and stuff out of your teeth if you swish water before drinking it.	game/hospital.rpy	3529	i "[what]"
trial3s_d628d600	l	I like that Sid! Dental hygeine is important!	game/hospital.rpy	3530	l "[what]"
trial3s_fde665c4	b	...Okay, so again, what I was saying is it had to-{p=0.5}{nw}	game/hospital.rpy	3531	b "[what]"
trial3s_85d2c2c9	d	Hm, yes, I guess the medical glue is the most likely way one would hide the bottles on the pipe.	game/hospital.rpy	3532	d "[what]"
trial3s_0b3b0382	b	...{size=-8}He just said what I was going to say...{/size}	game/hospital.rpy	3533	b "[what]"

trial3s_cbebafbd	d	Sorry Bert, were you saying something?	game/hospital.rpy	3535	d "[what]"
trial3s_96467f13	bi	Let me show you who's the boss around here...	game/hospital.rpy	3536	bi "[what]"
trial3s_0ab19a95	b	Yeah! We still need to figure out how the bottles came free from the pipe!	game/hospital.rpy	3537	b "[what]"
trial3s_7d791bae	d	I see. So you're saying maybe the bottles weren't hidden on top of the pipe after all.	game/hospital.rpy	3538	d "[what]"
trial3s_d1da5c17	d	A bit of an unexpected argument from you, Bert, given that it's your own theory they were hidden up there.	game/hospital.rpy	3539	d "[what]"
trial3s_780901ba	b	...{size=-8}I hate Dracula so much right now.{/size}	game/hospital.rpy	3540	b "[what]"
trial3s_41edba64	d	What was that?	game/hospital.rpy	3541	d "[what]"
trial3s_8ecabfe5	b	Um... I'm just trying to poke holes in my own theory to make sure it's correct.	game/hospital.rpy	3542	b "[what]"
trial3s_fb161b39	b	Yeah, that's it.	game/hospital.rpy	3543	b "[what]"
trial3s_53cf420c	b	If we can figure out how the bottles came free from the pipe, then we can be pretty sure about this explanation.	game/hospital.rpy	3544	b "[what]"
trial3s_c9d050b8	d	Au contraire.	game/hospital.rpy	3545	d "[what]"
trial3s_35ba70ca	b	What?	game/hospital.rpy	3546	b "[what]"
trial3s_140eb247	d	It means, "on the contrary."	game/hospital.rpy	3547	d "[what]"
trial3s_a28cee9a	d	I think it's pretty clear that the bottles couldn't have come free from the pipe last night...	game/hospital.rpy	3548	d "[what]"
trial3s_85caae58	d	In other words, your theory is still full of holes, Bert.	game/hospital.rpy	3549	d "[what]"
trial3t_ab73cb24	b	There's one way to remotely dislodge the bottle, if it was held in place using medical glue...	game/hospital.rpy	3569	b "[what]"
trial3t_d484bbed	b	Using the computer in the security room.	game/hospital.rpy	3570	b "[what]"
trial3t_3f87b23d	d	Bert, did you not hear the last thing I said?	game/hospital.rpy	3571	d "[what]"
trial3t_5e16c079	d	No one could be on the guard side last night, when you propose that the bottle fell.	game/hospital.rpy	3572	d "[what]"
trial3t_838a5409	d	The computer is on the guard side.	game/hospital.rpy	3573	d "[what]"
trial3t_be9e3b2d	b	That's true, but one of the functions the computer has gets around this issue...	game/hospital.rpy	3574	b "[what]"
trial3t_c3595412	b	It also uniquely is useful for getting rid of the medical glue holding the bottle in place.	game/hospital.rpy	3575	b "[what]"
trial3u_4d1368f5	b	That function is...	game/hospital.rpy	3578	b "[what]" nointeract
trial3u_cf991a61	bi	Yeah! If you stare at the cafeteria hard enough, the bottle will crack under the pressure!	game/hospital.rpy	3581	bi "[what]"
trial3u_a78280a0	bi	Wait... that made no sense.	game/hospital.rpy	3582	bi "[what]"
trial3u_a49a3b24	bi	You'd have to be the kind of person who deliberately tries wrong answers in a video game to think that.	game/hospital.rpy	3583	bi "[what]"
trial3u_ab84981a	bi	Hm, maybe if the medical glue were right next to a light, the heat from the light could melt it...	game/hospital.rpy	3586	bi "[what]"
trial3u_9fb40e49	bi	But there's some space between the pipes and the ceiling, so that seems unlikely.	game/hospital.rpy	3587	bi "[what]"
trial3u_a6cf2205	bi	That's it!	game/hospital.rpy	3590	bi "[what]"
trial3u_8b9fa0b0	bi	It's true that if you could make the building hot enough, the glue would melt...	game/hospital.rpy	3592	bi "[what]"
trial3u_012b4da6	bi	But there's no way a thermostat can get the building to be that hot without us boiling to death.	game/hospital.rpy	3593	bi "[what]"
trial3u_51995742	b	The hot water cycling.	game/hospital.rpy	3595	b "[what]"
trial3u_98983167	b	The medical glue is made to be easily removable by applying a towel dipped in boiling water to it.	game/hospital.rpy	3596	b "[what]"
trial3u_e5bd82de	b	If you cycled hot water through the pipes, the glue, which would be attached to the pipes, could melt right off.	game/hospital.rpy	3597	b "[what]"
trial3u_9288f024	d	But that still doesn't answer my concern.	game/hospital.rpy	3598	d "[what]"
trial3u_4fa0fa3f	d	How would you activate such a feature without entering the guard side of the floor at night?	game/hospital.rpy	3599	d "[what]"
trial3u_8f7ae250	i	*cough* Oh, I remember...	game/hospital.rpy	3600	i "[what]"
trial3u_c800a0c1	i	There was a *cough* option to schedule a hot water cycle for the future.	game/hospital.rpy	3601	i "[what]"
trial3u_9ac4ef4b	i	The program also tells you when the last *cough* cycle was...	game/hospital.rpy	3602	i "[what]"
trial3u_2256db78	i	Lauren or Sam, if go check the program right now, we can see if one happened last night...	game/hospital.rpy	3603	i "[what]"
trial3u_b44439f5	s	...I'll go. I'm not doing much here...	game/hospital.rpy	3604	s "[what]"
trial3u_a362c814	l	Okay, not to be a Dracula, but I have one more concern...	game/hospital.rpy	3608	l "[what]"
trial3u_c2ef753d	l	The pipes are pretty high up.	game/hospital.rpy	3609	l "[what]"
trial3u_78659d29	l	And I think it's pretty unlikely anyone here could have thrown the bottle up and got it to stick.	game/hospital.rpy	3610	l "[what]"
trial3u_ed22f3d9	l	If the bottle was placed on top of the pipe, how did it get up there?	game/hospital.rpy	3611	l "[what]"
trial3u_404e9d54	bi	Well, I think this one's pretty simple to answer...	game/hospital.rpy	3612	bi "[what]"
trial3u_ce4a1c88	bi	There's a glaringly simple method to do this.	game/hospital.rpy	3613	bi "[what]"
trial3v_323437ab	b	There's a stepstool in the supply closet.	game/hospital.rpy	3627	b "[what]"
trial3v_5d07bdff	b	With that it should be pretty easy to place the bottle in a high location.	game/hospital.rpy	3628	b "[what]"
trial3v_ba87fd6c	s	...Just like Sid said, the computer shows hot water cycled about an hour before we woke up...	game/hospital.rpy	3633	s "[what]"
trial3v_a23d20e2	i	*cough* I think the theory is right then!	game/hospital.rpy	3634	i "[what]"
trial3v_fb8e38d4	i	We just need to also see if *cough* the stepstool is enough to reach the top of the pipe.	game/hospital.rpy	3635	i "[what]"
trial3v_6e781473	l	I can do that, just give me a minute...	game/hospital.rpy	3636	l "[what]"
trial3v_850ef128	b	...	game/hospital.rpy	3638	b "[what]"
trial3v_e516b81e	bi	We waited for a bit in silence.	game/hospital.rpy	3641	bi "[what]"
trial3v_a4144edb	bi	My heart was pounding.	game/hospital.rpy	3642	bi "[what]"
trial3v_14c1ac02	bi	It was like I had just all-in'd at a poker table...	game/hospital.rpy	3643	bi "[what]"
trial3v_4927feb9	bi	No matter how good your hand is, until the cards are shown, you can rarely be sure you've won.	game/hospital.rpy	3644	bi "[what]"
trial3v_b017bda8	bi	Your King pair might lose to an Ace pair, the one card that loses you the hand might appear on the river...	game/hospital.rpy	3645	bi "[what]"
trial3v_0c408a95	bi	Or, in our case...	game/hospital.rpy	3646	bi "[what]"
trial3v_37b4dd90	bi	One mistake, one thing we overlooked, and we'd be back to square one.	game/hospital.rpy	3647	bi "[what]"
trial3v_c1dd7b14	bi	With no clue who killed Shahar or how they did it.	game/hospital.rpy	3648	bi "[what]"
trial3v_be206b3a	l	I tried placing the stepstool under the pipe and reaching, but...	game/hospital.rpy	3654	l "[what]"
trial3v_fad4228b	l	I couldn't do it standing. I would have to jump a bit to touch the top of the pipe.	game/hospital.rpy	3655	l "[what]"
trial3v_8191d809	l	I don't think I could have placed anything on top without it falling if I tried.	game/hospital.rpy	3656	l "[what]"
trial3v_9f5483ab	l	Unless there's a ladder somewhere that we don't know about, well...	game/hospital.rpy	3657	l "[what]"
trial3v_4a541908	l	I don't think the bottle could have been hidden on top of the pipe.	game/hospital.rpy	3658	l "[what]"
trial3v_ea30fc84	i	Are you sure? *cough* I thought we were about to nab the killer!	game/hospital.rpy	3659	i "[what]"
trial3v_5877bb64	l	Well, not exactly.	game/hospital.rpy	3660	l "[what]"
trial3v_861b91a3	l	At best we were about to find out how they did it, but not who did it.	game/hospital.rpy	3661	l "[what]"
trial3v_0a9034a9	l	Regardless, we're back to square one.	game/hospital.rpy	3662	l "[what]"
trial3v_850ef128_1	b	...	game/hospital.rpy	3663	b "[what]"
trial3v_35893197	b	No, this is perfect, actually.	game/hospital.rpy	3664	b "[what]"
trial3v_b1567157	l	Um... Bert?	game/hospital.rpy	3665	l "[what]"
trial3v_bcd4bec3	l	Saying "this is perfect" when we're back to square one on solving a murder...	game/hospital.rpy	3666	l "[what]"
trial3v_73b86eb0	l	Not exactly a good look.	game/hospital.rpy	3667	l "[what]"
trial3v_554a8040	b	Sorry, let me explain.	game/hospital.rpy	3668	b "[what]"
trial3v_385aa469	b	Lauren, you said you would have to jump a bit, right?	game/hospital.rpy	3669	b "[what]"
trial3v_ff95aabf	b	Exactly how far away were you from reaching the top of the pipe?	game/hospital.rpy	3670	b "[what]"
trial3v_f398ea88	l	Well, standing and reaching up, my hand was about a foot short of the pipe.	game/hospital.rpy	3671	l "[what]"
trial3v_3a11ad2c	b	So that just means you couldn't have placed the bottle safely.	game/hospital.rpy	3672	b "[what]"
trial3v_b5e2f20c	b	But someone else could have.	game/hospital.rpy	3673	b "[what]"
trial3v_adea05de	b	And with that, I think we've found the killer.	game/hospital.rpy	3674	b "[what]"
trial3v_81ea775e	b	The killer is...	game/hospital.rpy	3675	b "[what]"
trial3w_a1531506	b	Dracula.	game/hospital.rpy	3690	b "[what]"
trial3w_c2e16196	b	The rest of us are about Lauren's height, or less.	game/hospital.rpy	3691	b "[what]"
trial3w_82e5fca7	i	Who are you talking about when you say *cough* less?...	game/hospital.rpy	3692	i "[what]"
trial3w_bb21c61c	b	Uh... Freddy.	game/hospital.rpy	3693	b "[what]"
trial3w_d0878a65	i	Oh. Yeah, that makes sense.	game/hospital.rpy	3694	i "[what]"
trial3w_4bbacdfc	b	But Dracula... he's almost a foot taller than the rest of us.	game/hospital.rpy	3695	b "[what]"
trial3w_0cbb92eb	b	So if Lauren was about a foot short of the pipe...	game/hospital.rpy	3696	b "[what]"
trial3w_89debe1a	b	Between Dracula's height and his longer arms, with the stepstool...	game/hospital.rpy	3697	b "[what]"
trial3w_6b3783b6	b	He's the perfect height to place something on the pipes.	game/hospital.rpy	3698	b "[what]"
trial3w_1523fe20	d	...	game/hospital.rpy	3699	d "[what]"
trial3w_f5383146	d	I see. This must be how Sid felt this entire time.	game/hospital.rpy	3700	d "[what]"
trial3w_1043e735	b	Huh?	game/hospital.rpy	3701	b "[what]"
trial3w_bf864017	d	He was also falsely accused earlier, as I am now.	game/hospital.rpy	3702	d "[what]"
trial3w_4fc133b1	d	However, I am not nearly as reactionary as he is.	game/hospital.rpy	3703	d "[what]"
trial3w_58d03b7f	d	I have good reason to remain calm.	game/hospital.rpy	3704	d "[what]"
trial3w_7ef17b64	d	There is still a hole in your theory.	game/hospital.rpy	3705	d "[what]"
trial3w_a5f504a4	d	You have been lucky that the first few were patched up.	game/hospital.rpy	3706	d "[what]"
trial3w_9002e6c6	d	But this one I am not sure how you will work your way past.	game/hospital.rpy	3707	d "[what]"
trial3w_f881fa20	b	A hole?	game/hospital.rpy	3708	b "[what]"
trial3w_516e67b9	bi	I can feel it... he's on the defensive.	game/hospital.rpy	3711	bi "[what]"
trial3w_f10f4d01	bi	If he's right and I'm falsely accusing him... well, I got us all killed.	game/hospital.rpy	3712	bi "[what]"
trial3w_25f76cac	bi	But I can tell. He had been fighting so hard against this theory the moment we came up with it.	game/hospital.rpy	3713	bi "[what]"
trial3w_66cc2ac6	bi	Far moreso than anyone else.	game/hospital.rpy	3714	bi "[what]"
trial3w_02d0f971	bi	In the mansion, he played a more passive role.	game/hospital.rpy	3715	bi "[what]"
trial3w_cbc77fe6	bi	But this time... he's been aggressively trying to blame others.	game/hospital.rpy	3716	bi "[what]"
trial3w_6a96e79a	bi	So I don't think I'm going to get us all killed here...	game/hospital.rpy	3717	bi "[what]"
trial3w_b31a869d	bi	No... I'm going to save everyone.	game/hospital.rpy	3718	bi "[what]"
trial3w_b637b6da	d	Bert, you're staring into space again. It's quite rude to do that while I'm fighting for my life.	game/hospital.rpy	3719	d "[what]"
trial3w_df3462c1	b	Oh sorry. Yes, the hole in my theory?	game/hospital.rpy	3721	b "[what]"
trial3w_bc6cbad4	d	Please listen without spacing out this time, I beseech you...	game/hospital.rpy	3722	d "[what]"
trial3x_904a7c6b	b	One annoying thing about this game that we learned...	game/hospital.rpy	3742	b "[what]"
trial3x_3e9541ac	b	The killer always seems to get some sort of location-based advantage.	game/hospital.rpy	3743	b "[what]"
trial3x_4fef5753	b	Kaiser could somehow operate the train computer in ways the rest of us could not.	game/hospital.rpy	3744	b "[what]"
trial3x_0c0b3ff3	b	Catherine had access to a closet the rest of us thought was locked.	game/hospital.rpy	3745	b "[what]"
trial3x_18702208	b	And the killer here...	game/hospital.rpy	3746	b "[what]"
trial3x_243bc177	b	Could have been given a few coins.	game/hospital.rpy	3747	b "[what]"
trial3x_cd124361	b	A modest advantage compared to the others.	game/hospital.rpy	3748	b "[what]"
trial3x_58486b07	b	Because of this, it's harder to know what the truth behind the murder is.	game/hospital.rpy	3749	b "[what]"
trial3x_0208c119	b	There may be another theory for Shahar's death easily explained by a different advantage.	game/hospital.rpy	3750	b "[what]"
trial3x_85fa6413	b	So I don't think that's really a hole in our current understanding of things.	game/hospital.rpy	3751	b "[what]"
trial3x_4f4e895f	d	So you're relying on speculation about this advantage to pin the blame on me.	game/hospital.rpy	3752	d "[what]"
trial3x_8a2a5ec1	b	I would have before. But you let something loose.	game/hospital.rpy	3753	b "[what]"
trial3x_938fb212	b	You said root beer bottles were found in front of Shahar's body.	game/hospital.rpy	3754	b "[what]"
trial3x_648732c5	d	Were they not?	game/hospital.rpy	3755	d "[what]"
trial3x_f996344e	l	I never said they were root beer bottles.	game/hospital.rpy	3756	l "[what]"
trial3x_15a97eec	l	In fact, I had no idea what they were... there wasn't a label or anything when we found them.	game/hospital.rpy	3757	l "[what]"
trial3x_618fb25d	l	Just glass shards.	game/hospital.rpy	3758	l "[what]"
trial3x_6442ff71	b	Yet Dracula still knew what type of bottle it was, despite Lauren and Sam being the only ones to see it.	game/hospital.rpy	3759	b "[what]"
trial3x_f4d6858e	b	Well... not the only ones.	game/hospital.rpy	3760	b "[what]"
trial3x_cc68ab10	b	The killer saw the bottle too. They may have even seen it before the drink was emptied out.	game/hospital.rpy	3761	b "[what]"
trial3x_1888144d	d	Hmph. So what if I said root beer. As far as I know, root beer is the only drink in that vending machine.	game/hospital.rpy	3762	d "[what]"
trial3x_38168b8f	l	No, it's not.	game/hospital.rpy	3763	l "[what]"
trial3x_ebb223aa	l	I asked Sam about the drinks in the vending machine since I'm colorblind.	game/hospital.rpy	3764	l "[what]"
trial3x_520c04c9	l	There's clear, green, and brown drinks in there.	game/hospital.rpy	3765	l "[what]"
trial3x_44f109d7	l	You would have known that too with a single glance.	game/hospital.rpy	3766	l "[what]"
trial3x_095f4da9	d	Okay, but root beer is brown.	game/hospital.rpy	3767	d "[what]"
trial3x_c9885027	d	I must have had a slip of the tongue and just said root beer because I remembered the brown drink.	game/hospital.rpy	3768	d "[what]"
trial3x_b2826773	b	But cola is brown.	game/hospital.rpy	3769	b "[what]"
trial3x_9ee852a3	d	I'm really getting tired of this.	game/hospital.rpy	3770	d "[what]"
trial3x_5b196efd	d	So what if cola is brown? Root beer was in the vending machine.	game/hospital.rpy	3771	d "[what]"
trial3x_17dace3c	b	How could you tell it wasn't cola?	game/hospital.rpy	3772	b "[what]"
trial3x_c473d62f	d	By the taste.	game/hospital.rpy	3773	d "[what]"
trial3x_850ef128	b	...	game/hospital.rpy	3774	b "[what]"
trial3x_1523fe20	d	...	game/hospital.rpy	3775	d "[what]"
trial3x_24c99255	d	Oh.	game/hospital.rpy	3778	d "[what]"
trial3x_7d60dd1b	d	...It appears I have erred.	game/hospital.rpy	3779	d "[what]"
trial3x_5fe780ec	i	Um... can someone explain what just happened?	game/hospital.rpy	3780	i "[what]"
trial3x_c40273ad	b	The bottles in the vending machine weren't labelled.	game/hospital.rpy	3781	b "[what]"
trial3x_58428e55	blank	Yes, because labels would break copyright law and make this game unpublishable.	game/hospital.rpy	3782	blank "[what]"
trial3x_7ca94540	l	...Did you guys hear something?	game/hospital.rpy	3783	l "[what]"
trial3x_5f3b7847	b	Huh? No, just me talking.	game/hospital.rpy	3784	b "[what]"
trial3x_ba0031c2	b	Anyway, unless your eyes are UV scanners or something like that...	game/hospital.rpy	3785	b "[what]"
trial3x_18e6f71e	b	I don't think with a single glance you could tell the drink was cola.	game/hospital.rpy	3786	b "[what]"
trial3x_c85e87e4	b	It could have been any of the many brown sodas out there.	game/hospital.rpy	3787	b "[what]"
trial3x_aa1f1066	b	In fact, I thought it was cola when I first saw it.	game/hospital.rpy	3788	b "[what]"
trial3x_1b344cf7	b	The only way to know... would be to taste it, as Dracula just inadvertently admitted that he did.	game/hospital.rpy	3789	b "[what]"
trial3x_a6bbb2d0	b	But to taste it, you'd have to get the bottle out of the vending machine.	game/hospital.rpy	3790	b "[what]"
trial3x_19ec867a	b	Which is seemingly impossible to do without breaking into the vending machine...	game/hospital.rpy	3791	b "[what]"
trial3x_8a5d18e0	b	Unless you're the killer and have a location-based advantage.	game/hospital.rpy	3792	b "[what]"
trial3x_38fcc1f2	b	So, am I right?	game/hospital.rpy	3793	b "[what]"
trial3x_1523fe20_1	d	...	game/hospital.rpy	3794	d "[what]"
trial3x_540f8031	d	Yes, you're right. Though it's annoying the way you seem to be rubbing it in my face.	game/hospital.rpy	3795	d "[what]"
trial3x_53c9373b	bi	Huh?	game/hospital.rpy	3796	bi "[what]"
trial3x_1d41ba62	bi	His accent suddenly changed.	game/hospital.rpy	3797	bi "[what]"
trial3x_2b378d7f	d	Yes, I killed Shahar.	game/hospital.rpy	3798	d "[what]"
trial3x_721ca659	d	If only I hadn't blundered.	game/hospital.rpy	3799	d "[what]"
trial3x_1df7a0d4	d	I was going to press you on how Shahar ended up bloody and leaning against his cell door.	game/hospital.rpy	3800	d "[what]"
trial3x_633d8702	d	That was in fact, not part of my plan, so I don't think you would have found the answer.	game/hospital.rpy	3801	d "[what]"
trial3x_30178b55	d	I think I got lucky and he walked towards his cell door when he heard the bottle break.	game/hospital.rpy	3802	d "[what]"
trial3x_4ae87ca0	d	That or he was trying to identify the cause of the odor the gas has.	game/hospital.rpy	3803	d "[what]"
trial3x_a33bc85c	d	Or perhaps that was unlucky. After all, him dying by the bottle brought more attention to it...	game/hospital.rpy	3804	d "[what]"
trial3x_c436ad06	d	Oh well. If I get one bit of respite before I die, it's that I don't have to keep up that fake Romanian accent.	game/hospital.rpy	3805	d "[what]"
trial3x_5f5d9c29	d	Do me one last favor, let's not waste time with you guys telling me how bad I am for killing someone.	game/hospital.rpy	3806	d "[what]"
trial3x_9f509035	d	That routine is getting old, and will waste precious time.	game/hospital.rpy	3807	d "[what]"
trial3x_355c5fca	bi	Different accent, same level of contempt for everyone...	game/hospital.rpy	3808	bi "[what]"
trial3x_79ee1aa6	i	What?	game/hospital.rpy	3809	i "[what]"
trial3x_2892c911	i	Hey! You can't just kill him and act all cool!	game/hospital.rpy	3812	i "[what]"
trial3x_7cd92e31	i	He was a person with hopes and dreams! He was our friend!	game/hospital.rpy	3813	i "[what]"
trial3x_3a870432	d	I doubt Shahar was really friends with anyone here.	game/hospital.rpy	3814	d "[what]"
trial3x_c2618a25	d	At least, the real Shahar wasn't.	game/hospital.rpy	3815	d "[what]"
trial3x_11d1b742	l	I suspect you know more about Shahar that you haven't disclosed until now...	game/hospital.rpy	3816	l "[what]"
trial3x_973f8bea	d	Indeed. I'm not sure how these chips work...	game/hospital.rpy	3817	d "[what]"
trial3x_c75677b2	d	No, I don't need to lie anymore. The Game Master can kill me at a moment's notice.	game/hospital.rpy	3818	d "[what]"

trial3x_764eceb7	l	He's right. When Catherine died we learned some useful information from her.	game/hospital.rpy	3827	l "[what]"
trial3x_ee2ec8bd	l	I... I'm angry too. But we have to remember Dracula only did what he was forced to do.	game/hospital.rpy	3828	l "[what]"
trial3x_c7997baa	d	If anything, me killing Shahar, who was living a lie, was the most altruistic choice.	game/hospital.rpy	3829	d "[what]"

trial3x_a820fc29	l	What was that noise?	game/hospital.rpy	3839	l "[what]"
trial3x_b75a6eb1	l	The cell doors just opened on both sides.	game/hospital.rpy	3844	l "[what]"
trial3x_8f323aeb	l	I guess... so we can reunite before we go to sleep?	game/hospital.rpy	3845	l "[what]"

trial3x_c32eed08	l	I'm gonna go keep an eye on them, I'll listen though.	game/hospital.rpy	3892	l "[what]"
trial3x_f626dfec	d	Alright, let's begin.	game/hospital.rpy	3895	d "[what]"
trial3x_73e5d100	d	First, this isn't exactly a surprise, but my name isn't Dracula.	game/hospital.rpy	3896	d "[what]"
trial3x_8fc80863	j	Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!?!?!?!?!?!?!	game/hospital.rpy	3901	j "[what]"
trial3x_a5eeafee	dr	It is Ivan Nepomniachtchi.	game/hospital.rpy	3903	dr "[what]"
trial3x_69a92fc0	dr	I kept a false name because I thought some of the other people here might recognize me.	game/hospital.rpy	3904	dr "[what]"
trial3x_00b24aa2	dr	For reasons I will hopefully have time to cover before I pass.	game/hospital.rpy	3905	dr "[what]"
trial3x_5d0606f1	dr	I was once a surgeon. I'd like to think a respected one.	game/hospital.rpy	3906	dr "[what]"
trial3x_b999b1c9	dr	One night, towards the end of a 24-hour shift, I botched a surgery for a rich patient.	game/hospital.rpy	3907	dr "[what]"
trial3x_cb3b4ac0	dr	I was sued, medical malpractice insurance didn't want to cover.	game/hospital.rpy	3908	dr "[what]"
trial3x_86b8680e	dr	I lost my license.	game/hospital.rpy	3909	dr "[what]"
trial3x_d034de1f	dr	I was unable to find legitimate work, so I turned to more seedy practices.	game/hospital.rpy	3910	dr "[what]"
trial3x_c9a314a3	dr	Organ harvesting, selling prescription pills illegally...	game/hospital.rpy	3911	dr "[what]"
trial3x_1b2f7e45	dr	Truth be told, I only wanted to do it until I could find proper work.	game/hospital.rpy	3912	dr "[what]"
trial3x_82bd6c44	dr	But the money was good. Too good.	game/hospital.rpy	3913	dr "[what]"
trial3x_62cc3366	dr	Eventually, a legal team reached out to me.	game/hospital.rpy	3914	dr "[what]"
trial3x_8b4dcacd	dr	They worked for one of the largest companies in the world...	game/hospital.rpy	3915	dr "[what]"
trial3x_058d58ae	dr	Cantoire Management.	game/hospital.rpy	3916	dr "[what]"
trial3x_a4efcca1	bi	!	game/hospital.rpy	3917	bi "[what]"
trial3x_edd0156b	dr	I know what you're thinking. But no, Stella never met me.	game/hospital.rpy	3918	dr "[what]"
trial3x_493fec13	dr	Cantoire Management is... extremely large.	game/hospital.rpy	3919	dr "[what]"
trial3x_c43e2e2d	dr	In the hierarchy of the company, I was probably at least five rungs below her.	game/hospital.rpy	3920	dr "[what]"
trial3x_48c2f991	dr	But I obviously knew about her coming into the game.	game/hospital.rpy	3921	dr "[what]"
trial3x_a74dcd00	dr	Anyway, the legal team reached out to me for one purpose.	game/hospital.rpy	3922	dr "[what]"
trial3x_49caeddc	dr	One of the services I offered was lobotomy.	game/hospital.rpy	3923	dr "[what]"
trial3x_e17fff0f	dr	I could forcibly give people amnesia.	game/hospital.rpy	3924	dr "[what]"
trial3x_fdc23d2b	dr	Essentially, they used me as a "cleaner" for some of their lawyers.	game/hospital.rpy	3925	dr "[what]"
trial3x_e5b18eaf	dr	The company had some shady tactics, to put it simply, and they felt it was useful to tie up loose ends.	game/hospital.rpy	3926	dr "[what]"
trial3x_3f7ca5cf	dr	Make people's memories of what the company did disappear without killing them.	game/hospital.rpy	3927	dr "[what]"
trial3x_da32e9c0	dr	Murder is easy to sue someone for, brain damage that could be caused by a simple accident?	game/hospital.rpy	3928	dr "[what]"
trial3x_b7dd0a57	dr	That is the crime that ties me to this location. Many of my victims ended up here.	game/hospital.rpy	3929	dr "[what]"
trial3x_77fd886a	dr	For enough of a bribe, they asked no questions about the patients' conditions.	game/hospital.rpy	3930	dr "[what]"
trial3x_63be6efb	dr	I'm sure you can see where this is going now.	game/hospital.rpy	3931	dr "[what]"
trial3x_411d72c1	dr	In his former life, Shahar was a young doe-eyed lawyer who started working for Cantoire Management.	game/hospital.rpy	3932	dr "[what]"
trial3x_2b36d0a6	dr	I lobotomized him afterwards.	game/hospital.rpy	3933	dr "[what]"
trial3x_ca2b54f7	b	Wha-	game/hospital.rpy	3934	b "[what]"
trial3x_526d3b08	b	Sorry, I didn't mean to speak, I'm just... shocked, I guess.	game/hospital.rpy	3935	b "[what]"
trial3x_659a7145	dr	Understandable. The people I've worked with...	game/hospital.rpy	3936	dr "[what]"
trial3x_4459aa4e	dr	They live in a world far beyond what most of you can comprehend.	game/hospital.rpy	3937	dr "[what]"
trial3x_5a1f4ef4	dr	If I'm right about who is behind the game, even they are an angel compared to those people.	game/hospital.rpy	3938	dr "[what]"
trial3x_6e9b4c9a	bi	...Right about who's behind the game?	game/hospital.rpy	3939	bi "[what]"
trial3x_8cd1fe5f	dr	Anyway, as Bert managed to figure out before I got to access the computer, Shahar was a patient here.	game/hospital.rpy	3940	dr "[what]"
trial3x_b2f9d281	dr	It was here he developed his false belief that he was a pirate.	game/hospital.rpy	3941	dr "[what]"
trial3x_cce96de0	dr	The cafeteria we were just in, he believed was his ship. His fellow patients his crewmates.	game/hospital.rpy	3942	dr "[what]"
trial3x_ec4be840	dr	Anyway, I'm sure many of you are shocked...	game/hospital.rpy	3943	dr "[what]"
trial3x_16e1a598	dr	This is perhaps where if this was a college lecture, I would stop to answer questions.	game/hospital.rpy	3944	dr "[what]"
trial3x_ec9e2dc6	dr	So, have at it.	game/hospital.rpy	3945	dr "[what]"
trial3x_98548a57	bi	This... it's almost too much to handle.	game/hospital.rpy	3946	bi "[what]"
trial3x_898a12b2	bi	We always knew we were all criminals but...	game/hospital.rpy	3947	bi "[what]"
trial3x_d2238d66	bi	I didn't think anyone this deeply involved in crime was a participant.	game/hospital.rpy	3948	bi "[what]"
trial3x_c788c052	bi	...But as gruesome and shocking as it is...	game/hospital.rpy	3949	bi "[what]"
trial3x_cedc1433	bi	This is maybe our first chance to really learn the truth behind the game.	game/hospital.rpy	3950	bi "[what]"
trial3x_7f72b840	bi	For the others... for Shahar, even. I can't pass that opportunity up.	game/hospital.rpy	3951	bi "[what]"
dracAsk_8c601560	bi	What to ask...	game/hospital.rpy	3956	bi "[what]" nointeract
dracAsk_6d11a546	dr	Well... the human brain is a very complicated machine.	game/hospital.rpy	3959	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_3967c5f7	dr	Despite my best efforts, the ways I make people forget the past are imperfect.	game/hospital.rpy	3960	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_5f34d362	dr	One time I came to this hospital while Shahar was a patient here.	game/hospital.rpy	3961	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_1256296f	dr	He recognized me, when I stared at him through his door.	game/hospital.rpy	3962	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_0cd51d91	dr	So when we got here, I thought...	game/hospital.rpy	3963	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_bd1d947b	dr	Perhaps he regained his memory. And this was all his doing.	game/hospital.rpy	3964	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_a1302243	dr	He may have remembered the events leading to his lobotomy.	game/hospital.rpy	3965	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_6d6de280	dr	So he'd have a reason to put us through this game	game/hospital.rpy	3966	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_f5a6ef9d	dr	And even if he wasn't the Game Master, if he remembered who I was, you all would kill me regardless.	game/hospital.rpy	3967	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_97b7a0ba	dr	So I set about destroying the evidence, as it were.	game/hospital.rpy	3968	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_4fb87e42	dr	When I got to the computer, I deleted his record from there, believing what Bert had said.	game/hospital.rpy	3969	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_5e9ebe39	dr	I thought no one would see it after that, but I was wrong.	game/hospital.rpy	3970	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_7fd1bb75	dr	Also, when we arrived here, I was the first to the cafeteria.	game/hospital.rpy	3971	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_64df5410	dr	I was able to remove Shahar's picture from the wall, and hide it in my cell.	game/hospital.rpy	3972	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_c59b3e76	dr	And the last move... was to delete Shahar's memory in the only foolproof manner.	game/hospital.rpy	3973	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_2b259a86	b	...By killing him.	game/hospital.rpy	3974	b "[what]"
dracAsk_56e78d02	dr	Yes, though it's less romantic when you put it that way.	game/hospital.rpy	3975	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_a9950916	bi	I'm not sure romance is of importance here...	game/hospital.rpy	3976	bi "[what]"
dracAsk_5218aa2e	dr	Sid mentioned a case earlier, where he planted fake emails on Sydell's servers.	game/hospital.rpy	3980	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_e73fe1e6	dr	Shahar was on the legal team for that case.	game/hospital.rpy	3981	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_a4efcca1	bi	!	game/hospital.rpy	3982	bi "[what]"
dracAsk_90f3ec87	dr	I only heard about it secondhand when I was given the job, but this is my understanding.	game/hospital.rpy	3983	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_20aaccd9	dr	He wasn't the one who reached out to Sid, I believe, which is why Sid didn't know him.	game/hospital.rpy	3984	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_80854107	dr	But he is the one who suggested planting the fake emails to tank Sydell's company.	game/hospital.rpy	3985	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_7f6899a3	dr	Someone else on the team blackmailed Sid.	game/hospital.rpy	3986	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_6578b115	i	He did what?	game/hospital.rpy	3992	i "[what]"
dracAsk_8d15ca72	i	Grr. Never mind, I'm glad he's dead!	game/hospital.rpy	3993	i "[what]"
dracAsk_ef94736d	dr	You shouldn't be glad he's dead.	game/hospital.rpy	3994	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_a1ceef6b	dr	Even if by some moral code that Shahar deserved to die... the Shahar you met was a different one.	game/hospital.rpy	3995	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_6df8910e	i	Hmph. I hate when adults tell me how to feel.	game/hospital.rpy	3998	i "[what]"
dracAsk_1062f274	dr	Listen, Shahar was a fairly admirable lawyer.	game/hospital.rpy	3999	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_4d090987	dr	He didn't know what he was getting into when he joined Cantoire Management.	game/hospital.rpy	4000	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_43d2a970	dr	The case you helped with was his first case with the company, and he was planning to resign right after.	game/hospital.rpy	4001	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_bea536e3	dr	Unfortunately for him... well, I came into the picture.	game/hospital.rpy	4002	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_d81addea	dr	They were afraid that if he left the company, he could leak the fact that the emails were fake.	game/hospital.rpy	4003	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_2e6f41a7	dr	He had a strong sense of justice, according to his bosses. They though he would have taken the risk.	game/hospital.rpy	4004	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_f14b31cd	dr	No competitive firm would be willing to work with a whistleblower like that, which is normally enough.	game/hospital.rpy	4005	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_056c1799	dr	Cantoire Management has connections and that threat keeps most of their employees silent.	game/hospital.rpy	4006	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_561b6e2f	dr	But they thought he was the exception.	game/hospital.rpy	4007	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_eccb4f72	b	...Did he end up telling anyone?	game/hospital.rpy	4008	b "[what]"
dracAsk_a7ebdc1a	dr	No. They kidnapped him and brought him to me too quickly.	game/hospital.rpy	4009	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_4b62352f	dr	No better time than the present, as they say.	game/hospital.rpy	4010	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_6694e87c	b	Hmm... so you, Shahar, Sid, Mr. Sydell, were all connected through this lawsuit and the resulting events.	game/hospital.rpy	4011	b "[what]"
dracAsk_d98cd2ce	b	And indirectly, Stella was too.	game/hospital.rpy	4012	b "[what]"
dracAsk_62134d6b	b	Surely this ties to the game, right?	game/hospital.rpy	4013	b "[what]"
dracAsk_82813d0f	dr	You'd be foolish to think it didn't.	game/hospital.rpy	4014	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_a32d6b9f	dr	That's part of why I killed Shahar; he seemed like the most likely to seek some sort of revenge	game/hospital.rpy	4015	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_7d5b184b	dr	My best guess until now was Shahar.	game/hospital.rpy	4019	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_d825b8a5	dr	But he's dead. And as far as I can tell, I am about to die.	game/hospital.rpy	4020	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_0b849653	dr	So that means it wasn't him.	game/hospital.rpy	4021	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_bf38bc20	dr	Stella is also dead, Catherine inadvertently made a good choice in who to kill.	game/hospital.rpy	4022	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_b6ed88d4	dr	Clearly it's not me, and Sid is a child.	game/hospital.rpy	4023	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_4531a016	dr	But I'm fairly sure that lawsuit is part of, if not the key reason for this game.	game/hospital.rpy	4024	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_079c10d4	dr	The only person related to that case who isn't ruled out is...	game/hospital.rpy	4025	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_eecbba69	dr	Sydell.	game/hospital.rpy	4026	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_3bbd064b	b	You think he's the Game Master?	game/hospital.rpy	4027	b "[what]"
dracAsk_ff83735f	b	But he's not here with us...	game/hospital.rpy	4028	b "[what]"
dracAsk_570f193f	dr	Correct.	game/hospital.rpy	4029	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_6803379f	dr	I'm not sure how we are meant to win if we can't kill him, as he is not a participant.	game/hospital.rpy	4030	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_27a236bf	dr	But that is my best theory.	game/hospital.rpy	4031	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_6d844ae9	dr	Maybe the bitter reality is, he will kill us one by one in this game.	game/hospital.rpy	4032	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_0f5c10d4	dr	The game is not winnable, it is just entertainment for him.	game/hospital.rpy	4033	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_e477557e	dr	We are but gladiators in his empire, our sole purpose fight each other to the death.	game/hospital.rpy	4034	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_ac2f74b9	bi	...	game/hospital.rpy	4035	bi "[what]"
dracAsk_ecb41a3d	bi	No.	game/hospital.rpy	4036	bi "[what]"
dracAsk_1d4f2c3a	bi	I refuse to believe that...	game/hospital.rpy	4037	bi "[what]"
dracAsk_e744c8f8	bi	Because... if that's true, then we'll all die.	game/hospital.rpy	4038	bi "[what]"
dracAsk_9226ea9c	dr	People like to believe things that are false if it makes them comfortable.	game/hospital.rpy	4039	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_2b1a5128	dr	It's why we don't own up to our mistakes.	game/hospital.rpy	4040	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_72b2b7d9	bi	Ok, so maybe I'm human.	game/hospital.rpy	4041	bi "[what]"
dracAsk_a0277c0b	bi	But still... if there is a way for us to win this game, for us to live...	game/hospital.rpy	4042	bi "[what]"
dracAsk_5c010a5c	bi	We won't find it if we give up.	game/hospital.rpy	4043	bi "[what]"
dracAsk_bf0f707a	dr	Perhaps.	game/hospital.rpy	4044	dr "[what]"
dracAsk_da63effa	dr	That is no longer my concern, anyway.	game/hospital.rpy	4045	dr "[what]"

hospInvFreddy_cd9891d8	lf	Soon Freddy. I have some imoprtant work to do...	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1049	lf "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_2cf47a62	f	Important work?	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1050	f "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_c04e5df3	lf	Uh, remember all those debates we've had since we got here?	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1051	lf "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_a55b626f	lf	You know, before we fall asleep and wake up somewhere else.	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1052	lf "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_a197d64e	lf	We spend a lot of time asking each other questions and stuff like that?	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1053	lf "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_6a9868f9	f	Oh. Yeah, I remember those.	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1054	f "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_8f549fbc	lf	Well uh, before the debates, while you and I were playing, the others would usually find stuff for us.	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1055	lf "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_0a515bf8	lf	Stuff we needed to talk about.	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1056	lf "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_cb1aaa21	lf	But now it's my turn to do it.	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1057	lf "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_1ab42fa3	lf	Taking turns is fair, right Freddy?	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1058	lf "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_92daadba	f	Yeah... Lauren?	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1059	f "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_8022cfff	lf	Yeah?	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1060	lf "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_0c4929d0	f	Why does no one ever tell me anything?	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1061	f "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_230853b5	f	It's like the rest of you have secrets and I don't like it.	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1062	f "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_4271bed6	f	I... I know what "murder" means. I've watched TV, you know.	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1063	f "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_d533b2e4	f	That's what the superheroes do to the bad guys!	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1064	f "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_25d345da	li	He's right, we're being dishonest with him by trying to hide the dead bodies.	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1065	li "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_63f3f1f3	li	And then still having him sit through us trying to solve the murders.	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1066	li "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_1e0d6803	li	And kids catch on to more than we think.	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1067	li "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_9457229e	li	He probably knows someone is dead but knows we don't want to talk to him about it.	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1068	li "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_f5833bb0	li	Who knows, maybe he's seen a dead body before.	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1069	li "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_116ec94d	li	But... I can't let him be like me.	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1070	li "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_c4f1b0bc	li	Those weeks after the murder.	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1071	li "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_9a091915	li	No, not weeks. Years.	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1072	li "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_1fff40ef	li	I wouldn't want him to go through that.	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1073	li "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_5ccda8a6	lf	Freddy, there's some... stuff that kids shouldn't see.	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1074	lf "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_3cc3f9ac	f	Oh, like when daddy and his nurse locked the door and wouldn't let me in?	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1075	f "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_dddcd886	lf	Uh... not quite.	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1076	lf "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_b2302e6b	lf	Look, you... have a long life ahead of you.	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1077	lf "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_9a42ede2	lf	One you should get to enjoy as much as possible.	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1078	lf "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_1f0b1844	lf	Find lots of frogs, have lots of cake.	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1079	lf "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_10e42ec9	f	I do like cake and frogs.	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1080	f "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_856036a2	lf	Right. You'll have less fun if you see some of the things we're hiding.	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1081	lf "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_baa63c65	lf	We're old, we don't have our childhood anymore, so we don't need to worry about that.	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1082	lf "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_e9b61d6d	lf	Does that make sense?	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1083	lf "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_6548f970	f	...I think so.	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1084	f "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_e63466b3	lf	Sorry Freddy, I know it's no fun when others know more than you do.	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1085	lf "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_cbed3d8a	f	It's okay... I trust you Lauren.	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1086	f "[what]"
hospInvFreddy_75e7dbab	f	But you're taking me to a zoo when this is done!	game/hospscreens-inv.rpy	1087	f "[what]"

jennHang_f049301b	j	Hey Dan! What's up?	game/jenn-fte.rpy	119	j "[what]"
jennHang_5adf37f7	n	Not much, just figured it'd be good to talk to people while we're waiting around.	game/jenn-fte.rpy	120	n "[what]"
jennHang_09a34f1f	j	In that case, you want to check my work on a math problem?	game/jenn-fte.rpy	121	j "[what]"
jennHang_27e838b8	n	Uh... I'm not very good at math, but I'm down to listen.	game/jenn-fte.rpy	122	n "[what]"
jennHang_b1648f66	j	I'm just wondering, if we can identify the murderer every time and the murderer chooses a random victim...	game/jenn-fte.rpy	123	j "[what]"
jennHang_9c4f2720	j	How many of us escape on average?	game/jenn-fte.rpy	124	j "[what]"
jennHang_2d5e01af	j	I think the answer's between 4 and 5, but I'm not sure.	game/jenn-fte.rpy	125	j "[what]"
jennHang_3dd9ba18	n	That's... a rather dark math problem.	game/jenn-fte.rpy	126	n "[what]"
jennHang_ad60bd93	j	Well, I haven't really been able to stop thinking about our situation.	game/jenn-fte.rpy	128	j "[what]"
jennHang_80d71a6b	j	But that was kind of stressing me out for obvious reasons.	game/jenn-fte.rpy	129	j "[what]"
jennHang_835a7f96	j	So I decided to turn it into something at least a little bit relaxing.	game/jenn-fte.rpy	130	j "[what]"
jennHang_9be6984e	n	...you think math is relaxing?	game/jenn-fte.rpy	131	n "[what]"
jennHang_a9ea36ed	j	Yeah! Probability problems are basically just like figuring out games.	game/jenn-fte.rpy	133	j "[what]"
jennHang_ae9d69cf	j	And I love playing games.	game/jenn-fte.rpy	134	j "[what]"
jennHang_8078df0c	j	Also, I think giving myself reasonable expectations about our odds of surviving will make it easier in the long run.	game/jenn-fte.rpy	135	j "[what]"
jennHang_86607a81	j	Haha, expectations, no pun intended.	game/jenn-fte.rpy	136	j "[what]"
jennHang_21db1ad7	n	Oh yeah, good one.	game/jenn-fte.rpy	137	n "[what]"
jennHang_28d1630d	ni	I don't get it.	game/jenn-fte.rpy	138	ni "[what]"
jennHang_84a7a935	j	Anyway, we don't have to talk about math. But maybe I can pick your brain on something I'm wondering about...	game/jenn-fte.rpy	139	j "[what]"
jennHang_d0d9effb	j	What happens if there are four of us left and the murderer doesn't kill the Game Master?	game/jenn-fte.rpy	141	j "[what]"
jennHang_eedf8c22	n	What do you mean? Wouldn't there just be an investigation and vote?	game/jenn-fte.rpy	142	n "[what]"
jennHang_b5fe904e	j	Well, think about who'd remain after the murder.	game/jenn-fte.rpy	143	j "[what]"
jennHang_9729741d	j	You'd have the murderer themselves, the Game Master, and a third person.	game/jenn-fte.rpy	144	j "[what]"
jennHang_4950935d	j	The Game Master can pretty much just decide the vote on their own, since they can just vote w/ either person.	game/jenn-fte.rpy	145	j "[what]"
jennHang_7352ac1d	j	The Game Master survives regardless of what happens, so there isn't really an incentive for them to vote either way.	game/jenn-fte.rpy	146	j "[what]"
jennHang_7845c9c2	n	Well, after the vote it's just the Game Master and one person.	game/jenn-fte.rpy	147	n "[what]"
jennHang_f6820b6f	n	I don't imagine they brought us all here with the intent of having us survive.	game/jenn-fte.rpy	148	n "[what]"
jennHang_785c2430	n	So I'd imagine they'd just kill both people.	game/jenn-fte.rpy	149	n "[what]"
jennHang_28ee39b3	j	Hmm, maybe, but if they wanted to kill us all, why not just do it directly?	game/jenn-fte.rpy	150	j "[what]"
jennHang_6210f5e2	j	At any time we were all passed out, they could've easily done it.	game/jenn-fte.rpy	151	j "[what]"
jennHang_e64b8f2a	j	Seems like a lot of effort to set up this game that requires all these additional resources.	game/jenn-fte.rpy	152	j "[what]"
jennHang_f0b4e6de	n	I've been thinking about this a bit... maybe this game is meant to be torture.	game/jenn-fte.rpy	153	n "[what]"
jennHang_07b8adc7	j	Oh?	game/jenn-fte.rpy	154	j "[what]"
jennHang_e4e06b1b	n	Fates worse than death... a game where {i}innocent{/i} people have to kill each other might one of them.	game/jenn-fte.rpy	155	n "[what]"
jennHang_d121a5ba	ni	...did I pull off that lie convincingly enough?	game/jenn-fte.rpy	156	ni "[what]"
jennHang_a7c2c9f9	j	But then why would they put their lives on the line?	game/jenn-fte.rpy	157	j "[what]"
jennHang_a1f52414	ni	Seems like I did.	game/jenn-fte.rpy	158	ni "[what]"
jennHang_c8cb46a6	n	Maybe they lied, maybe there isn't a Game Master in this group at all.	game/jenn-fte.rpy	159	n "[what]"
jennHang_84d2ca39	n	They just want us to believe there is.	game/jenn-fte.rpy	160	n "[what]"
jennHang_f84e512a	j	Hm... as part of the torture? Giving us false hope?	game/jenn-fte.rpy	161	j "[what]"
jennHang_2fc48541	n	Something like that.	game/jenn-fte.rpy	162	n "[what]"
jennHang_98a815a1	j	Interesting...	game/jenn-fte.rpy	163	j "[what]"
jennHang_9bca9645	j	Thanks Dan! I think this was a productive conversation.	game/jenn-fte.rpy	165	j "[what]"
jennHang_14a6ed0a	n	So uh... did you ever solve that math problem?	game/jenn-fte.rpy	166	n "[what]"
jennHang_3debf087	j	What? Oh no, I started working on it, but then I thought about fashion for a bit, then it was time to eat.	game/jenn-fte.rpy	167	j "[what]"
jennHang_bb2cf764	n	...	game/jenn-fte.rpy	168	n "[what]"
jennHang_2efc7776	ni	For someone who likes math, she's pretty ditzy...	game/jenn-fte.rpy	170	ni "[what]"

laurHang_68e49da5	o	You're not much of a small talker, are you?	game/laur-fte.rpy	121	o "[what]"
laurHang_e3786c44	ni	No, but I can't seem like an unfriendly face in a situation like this.	game/laur-fte.rpy	122	ni "[what]"
laurHang_662e3505	n	Not really, no. Give me a second try?	game/laur-fte.rpy	123	n "[what]"
laurHang_e2a7f325	o	Sure.	game/laur-fte.rpy	124	o "[what]"
laurHang_57373af8	n	So you babysat in high school?	game/laur-fte.rpy	125	n "[what]"
laurHang_1f4c1a76	o	Yeah, hard to have a social life as a high school student without some cash.	game/laur-fte.rpy	126	o "[what]"
laurHang_26d7690b	n	Your parents didn't give you an allowance?	game/laur-fte.rpy	127	n "[what]"
laurHang_3cb41b43	o	My parents were well off, but pretty strict about only paying for necessary expenses.	game/laur-fte.rpy	128	o "[what]"
laurHang_8bcfbd50	o	They also wanted to instill discipline in me.	game/laur-fte.rpy	129	o "[what]"
laurHang_42807d4a	o	I liked kids more than most high schoolers, so it was more like a hobby.	game/laur-fte.rpy	130	o "[what]"
laurHang_599f42c9	o	Sometimes I even got lucky and found a gig where the kids just slept and I got paid do homework.	game/laur-fte.rpy	131	o "[what]"
laurHang_7f86a630	n	Wait, back up, you liked kids more than other high schoolers?	game/laur-fte.rpy	132	n "[what]"
laurHang_73f9dd37	o	Jesus, not in a weird way.	game/laur-fte.rpy	133	o "[what]"
laurHang_b1ac4c94	o	They just have a sense of wonder and sympathy that other teenagers never did.	game/laur-fte.rpy	134	o "[what]"
laurHang_9f8c584f	o	High schoolers sucked, but the kids that suck, I can teach them.	game/laur-fte.rpy	135	o "[what]"
laurHang_1f7e6438	n	I guess that's reasonable.	game/laur-fte.rpy	136	n "[what]"
laurHang_9d0df65b	n	And it is true, high schoolers did suck.	game/laur-fte.rpy	137	n "[what]"
laurHang_2a7f5dcd	ni	I was definitely a dick in my teens...	game/laur-fte.rpy	138	ni "[what]"
laurHang_3ab1cf9b	o	Some of them are assholes just because they think it's funny.	game/laur-fte.rpy	139	o "[what]"
laurHang_1a7fe3eb	o	You think they'd all of a sudden realize their actions affect others?	game/laur-fte.rpy	140	o "[what]"
laurHang_9e0745dc	o	The high schoolers that suck, nothing short of a kick in the ass from reality will make them learn.	game/laur-fte.rpy	141	o "[what]"
laurHang_52153ca6	ni	I was beginning to think this was a sore spot I shouldn't have pressed on.	game/laur-fte.rpy	142	ni "[what]"
laurHang_fa0be5cf	n	That's understandable, though I don't think I could ever think like that.	game/laur-fte.rpy	143	n "[what]"
laurHang_4ec09156	o	Sorry, I know I got kind of aggressive, but this brought back a lot of memories.	game/laur-fte.rpy	144	o "[what]"
laurHang_67c1e1b1	n	Sorry, didn't mean to make you upset.	game/laur-fte.rpy	145	n "[what]"
laurHang_41f02608	n	Just wanted to get to know you better.	game/laur-fte.rpy	146	n "[what]"
laurHang_ce5d0ea1	o	You were right originally, you're not great at small talk.	game/laur-fte.rpy	147	o "[what]"
laurHang_90369dcf	n	Yeah...	game/laur-fte.rpy	148	n "[what]"
laurHang_3d749629	ni	We stood in silence for a few seconds.	game/laur-fte.rpy	149	ni "[what]"
laurHang_32a0ae9f	n	Uh, I think I'll regroup with the others now.	game/laur-fte.rpy	150	n "[what]"
laurHang_ddc782ce	o	Uh huh.	game/laur-fte.rpy	151	o "[what]"
laurHang_ac78cd8d	ni	I left with no particular destination, just to give her space.	game/laur-fte.rpy	152	ni "[what]"
laurHang_252b4c8b	ni	I know more about Lauren now, but I can't say that conversation was a net positive.	game/laur-fte.rpy	154	ni "[what]"
laurHang_e24f240f	ni	Maybe I'll try again later.	game/laur-fte.rpy	155	ni "[what]"
laurHang_fd31c1cf	o	Hey Bert, what can I do for you?	game/laur-fte.rpy	159	o "[what]"
laurHang_2803fbb4	b	Oh, I wasn't looking for any favors or anything.	game/laur-fte.rpy	160	b "[what]"
laurHang_b4e38c60	o	I got that, just an expression. Wanted to chat?	game/laur-fte.rpy	161	o "[what]"
laurHang_847825af	b	Yeah, figure if we're all stuck here together for who knows how long we can get to know each other.	game/laur-fte.rpy	162	b "[what]"
laurHang_525a9d51	b	I did want to ask, seems like you're very protective of the kids. You said you were a babysitter in high school?	game/laur-fte.rpy	163	b "[what]"
laurHang_028f19f4	o	Well, hard to have a social life as a high school student without some cash.	game/laur-fte.rpy	164	o "[what]"
laurHang_3cb41b43_1	o	My parents were well off, but pretty strict about only paying for necessary expenses.	game/laur-fte.rpy	165	o "[what]"
laurHang_8bcfbd50_1	o	They also wanted to instill discipline in me.	game/laur-fte.rpy	166	o "[what]"
laurHang_42807d4a_1	o	I liked kids more than most high schoolers, so it was more like a hobby.	game/laur-fte.rpy	167	o "[what]"
laurHang_599f42c9_1	o	Sometimes I even got lucky and found a gig where the kids just slept and I got paid do homework.	game/laur-fte.rpy	168	o "[what]"
laurHang_9895a49f	b	That's a really nice mindset to have. I've heard stories of high schoolers who mistreated kids they babysat.	game/laur-fte.rpy	169	b "[what]"
laurHang_fee18f95	o	Yeah, I knew a few of those types in high school, and it sucks for the kid.	game/laur-fte.rpy	170	o "[what]"
laurHang_cdf12063	o	They're usually still at an age where that can make a lasting impression.	game/laur-fte.rpy	171	o "[what]"
laurHang_bd1e6a94	o	Later on when I found other ways to make money, I'd sometimes babysit for a reduced wage.	game/laur-fte.rpy	172	o "[what]"
laurHang_0fcf357d	o	Not to try to get more hours or anything, but I knew sometimes I'd undercut lazy babysitters in the process.	game/laur-fte.rpy	173	o "[what]"
laurHang_3e440845	b	You found other ways to make money? Like, you worked two jobs in high school?	game/laur-fte.rpy	174	b "[what]"
laurHang_8d49d4a4	o	It's... not something I'd like to talk to people I don't know that well about.	game/laur-fte.rpy	175	o "[what]"
laurHang_fa7a09a7	o	Not that it's something I'm ashamed of, but people are judgmental.	game/laur-fte.rpy	176	o "[what]"
laurHang_fdd3dc94	o	And I don't want to give anyone who might try to murder me reason to judge me.	game/laur-fte.rpy	177	o "[what]"
laurHang_858f6c6e	b	Fair enough, I won't push on it.	game/laur-fte.rpy	178	b "[what]"
laurHang_64248fa7	b	Though if you undercut a lazy babysitter on one job, wouldn't they just take a different one you didn't have time for?	game/laur-fte.rpy	179	b "[what]"
laurHang_24c878c4	o	Well, my family was well off enough that I went to a pretty good school.	game/laur-fte.rpy	180	o "[what]"
laurHang_411eacff	o	Lots of old money kids, whose parents would buy them most things.	game/laur-fte.rpy	181	o "[what]"
laurHang_76190274	o	So they considered themselves too dignified to work for low wages, or something like that.	game/laur-fte.rpy	182	o "[what]"
laurHang_7e49a35d	b	Why babysit in the first place then?	game/laur-fte.rpy	183	b "[what]"
laurHang_5c75a83b	o	Well, for example, there was one kid whose parents gave him a credit card, but no way to get cash.	game/laur-fte.rpy	184	o "[what]"
laurHang_634e0fc3	o	But high schoolers usually get paid in cash, rich high schoolers have nice houses to party in.	game/laur-fte.rpy	185	o "[what]"
laurHang_f0c0eab8	o	If you want to party, you need booze, and even with a fake ID if you buy booze on a credit card, your parents could see it.	game/laur-fte.rpy	186	o "[what]"
laurHang_9fc70fcd	o	Trust me, I know it sounds made up, but despite going to a "nice" high school I had plenty of morally questionable peers.	game/laur-fte.rpy	187	o "[what]"
laurHang_fab0606c	o	Not that drinking is morally questionable, but being a shit babysitter to party behind your parents back?	game/laur-fte.rpy	188	o "[what]"
laurHang_330b3ac0	o	There's other ways to make money as a high schooler that don't involve leaving a kid feeling alone in their own home.	game/laur-fte.rpy	189	o "[what]"
laurHang_cbce4e49	b	Damn, I wonder how many people like that were at my school that I didn't know about...	game/laur-fte.rpy	190	b "[what]"
laurHang_2e6a0da7	b	It takes a really strong moral compass to dedicate yourself like that to protecting kids that you have no obligation to help.	game/laur-fte.rpy	191	b "[what]"
laurHang_ed1137c6	o	Thanks, though I do feel like I have some obligation.	game/laur-fte.rpy	192	o "[what]"
laurHang_be34196e	b	What does that mean?	game/laur-fte.rpy	193	b "[what]"
laurHang_20085ffc	o	I probably said more than I meant to. Sorry, another thing I don't really want to talk about with people I don't know well.	game/laur-fte.rpy	194	o "[what]"
laurHang_0a855d6b	b	That's totally fine, thanks for opening up as much as you did.	game/laur-fte.rpy	195	b "[what]"
laurHang_8673ea4b	bi	On that note, we went to meet up with the others. I can feel Lauren and I slowly growing closer.	game/laur-fte.rpy	197	bi "[what]"
laurHang_f0a88b03	b	Hey Lauren, what does the SAB on your hoodie mean?	game/laur-fte.rpy	201	b "[what]"
laurHang_d8f88fc9	o	Our conversations keep coming to this, don't they.	game/laur-fte.rpy	202	o "[what]"
laurHang_1043e735	b	Huh?	game/laur-fte.rpy	203	b "[what]"
laurHang_3a548815	o	You seem genuinely interested in getting to know me so I'll tell you but...	game/laur-fte.rpy	204	o "[what]"
laurHang_a4bd36f8	o	You won't judge me and you won't tell others about it.	game/laur-fte.rpy	205	o "[what]"
laurHang_8a44c247	bi	Is that something I'm ready for? I don't know if we know each other that well.	game/laur-fte.rpy	206	bi "[what]"
laurHang_0e2162b3	b	Promise.	game/laur-fte.rpy	207	b "[what]"
laurHang_0bbfa85d	o	Alright.	game/laur-fte.rpy	208	o "[what]"
laurHang_7674e430	o	The S is short for the town I'm from, that part's pretty innocent.	game/laur-fte.rpy	209	o "[what]"
laurHang_31707ba6	o	The A and B stand for Arms and Bullets.	game/laur-fte.rpy	210	o "[what]"
laurHang_ad5fb388	o	It's a gun shop I was a frequent customer at.	game/laur-fte.rpy	211	o "[what]"
laurHang_65c22c8a	bi	Does... does she have a gun on her now?	game/laur-fte.rpy	212	bi "[what]"
laurHang_a552925e	o	You're shocked. I'll do you a favor and not count that as judging me.	game/laur-fte.rpy	213	o "[what]"
laurHang_186bf20c	bi	I didn't think my fear was {i}that{/i} transparent.	game/laur-fte.rpy	214	bi "[what]"
laurHang_f58cc2fb	o	...are you gonna say something?	game/laur-fte.rpy	215	o "[what]"
laurHang_638bc191	b	Sorry, I just... don't really know people who own guns.	game/laur-fte.rpy	216	b "[what]"
laurHang_49893979	b	So I've never really been near one.	game/laur-fte.rpy	217	b "[what]"
laurHang_0369d02d	o	It's fine, I'll do the talking for now.	game/laur-fte.rpy	218	o "[what]"
laurHang_e1f77619	o	To be clear, I'm not a stereotypical gun nut. And no, I don't have a gun with me.	game/laur-fte.rpy	219	o "[what]"
laurHang_5281d8ca	o	Growing up I had... an incident with a stranger while out with friends.	game/laur-fte.rpy	220	o "[what]"
laurHang_d2524ea3	o	One that honestly fucked me up pretty badly, not something a high school student should ever go through.	game/laur-fte.rpy	221	o "[what]"
laurHang_a0552df5	o	I grew up well off, but that doesn't mean I didn't walk past shady figures while hanging out or running errands.	game/laur-fte.rpy	222	o "[what]"
laurHang_2c39bf38	o	We live in a city where guns aren't hard to get...	game/laur-fte.rpy	223	o "[what]"
laurHang_31d65b8f	o	...so my parents decided I shouldn't leave the house as often for safety.	game/laur-fte.rpy	224	o "[what]"
laurHang_816d2a89	o	I protested, and after a long debate they agreed I could go out if I could protect myself.	game/laur-fte.rpy	225	o "[what]"
laurHang_8d27b155	o	So I got a concealed carry permit when I turned 18.	game/laur-fte.rpy	226	o "[what]"
laurHang_d9c53720	o	I ended up in another incident and... it was pretty clear just having the gun wasn't enough.	game/laur-fte.rpy	227	o "[what]"
laurHang_e5440f23	o	Needed to know how to aim it.	game/laur-fte.rpy	228	o "[what]"
laurHang_e960073a	o	I started taking classes and it turns out, with a little guidance my aim is pretty good.	game/laur-fte.rpy	229	o "[what]"
laurHang_1860852b	o	Like, winning competitions good.	game/laur-fte.rpy	230	o "[what]"
laurHang_8df6fa50	o	Eventually it got to the point where I was winning money from entering competitions.	game/laur-fte.rpy	231	o "[what]"
laurHang_25b6bbff	o	A lot more money than teenage me knew what to do with	game/laur-fte.rpy	232	o "[what]"
laurHang_9c494673	o	SAB even sponsored me and gave me discounts, which made it even more profitable.	game/laur-fte.rpy	233	o "[what]"
laurHang_3ea87c16	o	So... yeah, that's why I'm wearing a gun shop hoodie.	game/laur-fte.rpy	234	o "[what]"
laurHang_9817e3d1	b	Sorry, I don't know what to say.	game/laur-fte.rpy	235	b "[what]"
laurHang_713c5347	o	It's fine, I can imagine being shocked in your position.	game/laur-fte.rpy	236	o "[what]"
laurHang_4d0220b3	o	Look, I know guns are terrifying objects that have killed many people who didn't deserve it.	game/laur-fte.rpy	237	o "[what]"
laurHang_d332c3e4	o	There's a not-so-great culture surrounding them in many parts of the world.	game/laur-fte.rpy	238	o "[what]"
laurHang_120663c2	o	A lot of preventable violence due to guns, situations where another weapon wouldn't have time to do damage.	game/laur-fte.rpy	239	o "[what]"
laurHang_64effe29	o	Again, I've been involved in... incidents where I learned that all too well.	game/laur-fte.rpy	240	o "[what]"
laurHang_75d08d21	o	So I'm a huge advocate for heavier background checks and such.	game/laur-fte.rpy	241	o "[what]"
laurHang_3be3276c	o	I'd never pull out a gun if I didn't feel like I needed to.	game/laur-fte.rpy	242	o "[what]"
laurHang_a3248326	o	But after what happened, sometimes I'm just not comfortable enough to leave home without protection.	game/laur-fte.rpy	243	o "[what]"
laurHang_59ebf8aa	o	I don't expect you to understand without having gone through what I've gone through.	game/laur-fte.rpy	244	o "[what]"
laurHang_a03d3680	o	But I hope you can respect my decision and accept my claim that I'm responsible with these things.	game/laur-fte.rpy	245	o "[what]"
laurHang_64507df8	b	Yeah, I can respect that.	game/laur-fte.rpy	246	b "[what]"
laurHang_ef096b6f	b	Least I can do after you opened up like that.	game/laur-fte.rpy	247	b "[what]"
laurHang_1e8acaa1	o	Thanks, I honestly appreciate it a lot.	game/laur-fte.rpy	248	o "[what]"
laurHang_13cb4d10	bi	After a heavy conversation, we returned to the others.	game/laur-fte.rpy	250	bi "[what]"
laurHang_86831bbb	bi	I think I understand Lauren much better now.	game/laur-fte.rpy	251	bi "[what]"
laurHang_b4460c35	o	Hey Bert, gotta tell you, our conversations got real deep real fast.	game/laur-fte.rpy	257	o "[what]"
laurHang_acd28c0d	b	Yeah, sorry about that.	game/laur-fte.rpy	258	b "[what]"
laurHang_810ebfd0	b	I know you that sort of stuff is hard to talk to strangers who might want to kill you.	game/laur-fte.rpy	259	b "[what]"
laurHang_b8b57950	b	I appreciate your openness, totally get it if you wanna talk more casually.	game/laur-fte.rpy	260	b "[what]"
laurHang_a77232c9	o	Well, I'm pretty sure you're not going to try to kill me at this point.	game/laur-fte.rpy	261	o "[what]"
laurHang_e37f93ae	o	Not to bring up sore spots, but you're one of the few people who opened up about their crime.	game/laur-fte.rpy	262	o "[what]"
laurHang_32835995	o	And we haven't exactly been anywhere with access to roads.	game/laur-fte.rpy	263	o "[what]"
laurHang_c80a3e9f	o	So I don't really mind bringing it up.	game/laur-fte.rpy	264	o "[what]"
laurHang_d501fd1b	b	Well, even if you trust me, we haven't known each other that long.	game/laur-fte.rpy	265	b "[what]"
laurHang_0199f77a	o	I mean, I've gone through some shit, but I was able to use it to become stronger.	game/laur-fte.rpy	266	o "[what]"
laurHang_289db458	o	Or at least, stubborn enough to give the illusion of being strong.	game/laur-fte.rpy	267	o "[what]"
laurHang_96c53199	o	And it defines a lot of who I am. My main hobby came out of needing to feel safe.	game/laur-fte.rpy	268	o "[what]"
laurHang_3abc559e	o	So really, I don't mind talking about it.	game/laur-fte.rpy	269	o "[what]"
laurHang_a22e8565	o	But it would be nice if we could talk about something fun for once.	game/laur-fte.rpy	271	o "[what]"
laurHang_7de9273c	b	Sure, any ideas?	game/laur-fte.rpy	272	b "[what]"
laurHang_b840a23c	o	Hmm... tell me about your hobbies? Since you know about mine.	game/laur-fte.rpy	273	o "[what]"
laurHang_660b8b21	b	Well, recently I got into journaling.	game/laur-fte.rpy	274	b "[what]"
laurHang_2d0df378	b	This is still kind of a dark topic though.	game/laur-fte.rpy	275	b "[what]"
laurHang_a2338f1b	o	Only talk about it if you want to!	game/laur-fte.rpy	276	o "[what]"
laurHang_f3b9c82b	b	Well, you opened up a ton to me, I can open up back to you.	game/laur-fte.rpy	277	b "[what]"
laurHang_224e6adc	b	I got into it after my own... incident, as a way of therapy.	game/laur-fte.rpy	278	b "[what]"
laurHang_708281dc	b	It started out as a way to process emotions by turning them into words.	game/laur-fte.rpy	279	b "[what]"
laurHang_a3082c49	b	But eventually it became a nice way to chronicle what happened during my day.	game/laur-fte.rpy	280	b "[what]"
laurHang_d4e76391	b	It helps me keep track of my goals, I remember things people said to me more easily.	game/laur-fte.rpy	281	b "[what]"
laurHang_ffceb83e	b	Just overall helps me mentally feel like I'm part of the moment always.	game/laur-fte.rpy	282	b "[what]"
laurHang_5604101c	o	That's super cool!	game/laur-fte.rpy	283	o "[what]"
laurHang_8774d5a2	o	And it seems like you also turned something born out of dark necessities into a positive hobby.	game/laur-fte.rpy	284	o "[what]"
laurHang_a73bd8f9	o	So I guess that's one thing we have in common.	game/laur-fte.rpy	285	o "[what]"
laurHang_0f47f5c5	bi	We talked for a bit about other hobbies we had.	game/laur-fte.rpy	287	bi "[what]"
laurHang_5bb9b222	bi	I think I finally learned to talk to Lauren casually, we're much closer now.	game/laur-fte.rpy	288	bi "[what]"
laurHang_302c3312	bi	I enjoyed some time with Lauren, now that we were able to speak casually.	game/laur-fte.rpy	293	bi "[what]"

Mansionuno_0f3f279f	blank	In the present...	game/mansion.rpy	59	blank "[what]"
Mansionuno_ac2f74b9	bi	...	game/mansion.rpy	60	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_fd07303e	bi	Two people died...	game/mansion.rpy	61	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_3fba7e8f	bi	And there's nothing I could do to save them...	game/mansion.rpy	62	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_eedc0630	bi	I slowly came to my senses and looked to my left.	game/mansion.rpy	66	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_bf03aec7	f	nrg....	game/mansion.rpy	69	f "[what]"
Mansionuno_69ef3b14	bi	...no, that's not how I should think about it.	game/mansion.rpy	70	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_b2398c26	bi	There were ten people I did help save.	game/mansion.rpy	71	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_802bd748	bi	If we didn't investigate and uncover Kaiser's secrets, we...	game/mansion.rpy	72	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_60113dd1	bi	...we all would have been killed.	game/mansion.rpy	73	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_b490d493	bi	Though, I still feel no closer to figuring out who the game master is...	game/mansion.rpy	74	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_c2b628be	bi	Either way, I need to keep my guard up and protect everyone here.	game/mansion.rpy	75	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_07c4666c	f	Oh, Bert! Are you awake? Feeling okay?	game/mansion.rpy	77	f "[what]"
Mansionuno_a40985f1	bi	This kid's one of them.	game/mansion.rpy	78	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_fc4ab075	bi	I have to keep him safe.	game/mansion.rpy	79	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_94236df1	b	Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks for asking. How are you?	game/mansion.rpy	81	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_b9d0233a	f	Eh, kinda sleepy, like always.	game/mansion.rpy	82	f "[what]"
Mansionuno_ad3a2135	f	We're in a really nice house now though!	game/mansion.rpy	83	f "[what]"
Mansionuno_753325df	bi	For a kid he doesn't seem that shaken up about what just happened...	game/mansion.rpy	84	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_870d4ce9	bi	But looking around, I had to agree.	game/mansion.rpy	85	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_2042072b	bi	It seemed like we were in a very posh dining room. A nice change of pace from the crowded train...	game/mansion.rpy	87	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_ce4e35e8	f	Wait, Bert?	game/mansion.rpy	88	f "[what]"
Mansionuno_a9ea9d56	f	I... I thought you were just someone in my dream.	game/mansion.rpy	89	f "[what]"
Mansionuno_16fc03be	f	Does that mean...	game/mansion.rpy	90	f "[what]"
Mansionuno_edad44c3	f	Dan... Kaiser...	game/mansion.rpy	97	f "[what]"
Mansionuno_b78303d2	bi	Oh no. He's audibly tearing up.	game/mansion.rpy	98	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_95e40e73	bi	What do I do?	game/mansion.rpy	99	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_fee1f1e3	l	Hey Freddy, you doing okay?	game/mansion.rpy	106	l "[what]"
Mansionuno_c80d5ffb	l	You wanna look around and try to find food with me? Everyone's probably hungry after sleeping!	game/mansion.rpy	107	l "[what]"
Mansionuno_f457572f	f	S-sure...	game/mansion.rpy	108	f "[what]"
Mansionuno_b2af44dd	bi	Thank goodness for Lauren, she's great with the kids.	game/mansion.rpy	113	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_3da6ae3d	bi	Oh, everyone else is here too, waking up like us.	game/mansion.rpy	114	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_84d97044	d	Hmm. I see Lauren and Freddy have already started exploring.	game/mansion.rpy	117	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_979938e8	b	Something like that. I think she's just trying to keep him from crying.	game/mansion.rpy	118	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_44c21df9	d	Regardless, they have gone to a new area without consulting the rest of us.	game/mansion.rpy	119	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_f3aabce8	d	Seems somewhat rash.	game/mansion.rpy	120	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_e1d56bfa	d	As well, I was hoping we could discuss what little we've learned from Kaiser before his death.	game/mansion.rpy	121	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_8eb32751	s	I agree with the vampire.	game/mansion.rpy	127	s "[what]"
Mansionuno_f774ff7e	d	We may as well discuss it now, and catch those two up later.	game/mansion.rpy	128	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_8ad26c0a	s	No time to waste really...	game/mansion.rpy	129	s "[what]"
Mansionuno_0774c4b3	d	First, Kaiser mentioned the train we were in is very similar to a train he'd been in before.	game/mansion.rpy	130	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_a16817dc	d	It seems we're in some sort of mansion. Perhaps the murderer this time has been in this mansion before?	game/mansion.rpy	132	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_473b7754	c	Woah! So you think someone here has been in this mansion before?	game/mansion.rpy	141	c "[what]"
Mansionuno_45018dd3	d	It would make sense, yes?	game/mansion.rpy	142	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_2cb304d1	b	He has a point... If there were direct ties between Kaiser and the train, maybe...	game/mansion.rpy	145	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_b4787e6a	c	Maybe someone his direct ties to this mansion?	game/mansion.rpy	146	c "[what]"
Mansionuno_7127ea78	d	Precisely.	game/mansion.rpy	147	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_1b7ee2f6	d	In which case, while exploring let's look for clues that tie specific people to this place.	game/mansion.rpy	148	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_e5f11a8d	d	That way we can identify the murderer ahead of time.	game/mansion.rpy	149	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_c15c4c1a	d	Ideally they would just kill the Game Master and we all escape, but if not we can protect ourselves in this way.	game/mansion.rpy	150	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_330240ca	bi	Dracula's very calm and collected about this.	game/mansion.rpy	151	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_0d9a9bd4	bi	It seems like a pretty good plan, though maybe a bit optimistic.	game/mansion.rpy	153	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_b2a41468	d	Secondly, we know that Kaiser, Stella, and Sam have all admitted to some sort of crime.	game/mansion.rpy	154	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_d652026b	bi	Stella and Sam?	game/mansion.rpy	155	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_9c615e40	bi	Oh right...	game/mansion.rpy	156	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_83bce58e	t	I tore down competition, I burned bridges, you name it.	game/mansion.rpy	163	t "[what]"
Mansionuno_3e44043e	t	My methods don't always see eye-to-eye with the law, but, c'est la vie.	game/mansion.rpy	164	t "[what]"
Mansionuno_4c19ae5d	s	I used to sell drugs, mostly to upper-class business people and spoiled rich kids.	game/mansion.rpy	171	s "[what]"
Mansionuno_ce983886	d	And Bert almost admitted something on the train as well.	game/mansion.rpy	185	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_3a0c60d8	d	Remember what the screen said in the first room we met in?	game/mansion.rpy	186	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_154c4c19	scr	Their endings are deserved.	game/mansion.rpy	191	scr "[what]"
Mansionuno_0e3e7321	d	In other words, whoever put us here seems to think we all deserve to die.	game/mansion.rpy	195	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_1815b063	d	Surely you can all finish this train of thought on your own.	game/mansion.rpy	196	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_ccecfe32	s	We're all criminals.	game/mansion.rpy	198	s "[what]"
Mansionuno_ef6a4bc9	bi	Criminal?	game/mansion.rpy	199	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_0e04f259	bi	I wouldn't call myself that...	game/mansion.rpy	200	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_ac2f74b9_1	bi	...	game/mansion.rpy	201	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_bd770040	bi	But I wasn't ready emotionally to contest that statement.	game/mansion.rpy	203	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_bbc12877	bi	So I stayed silent.	game/mansion.rpy	204	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_69a92577	i	No way, that doesn't make any sense.	game/mansion.rpy	208	i "[what]"
Mansionuno_f0365518	i	I mean, I'm only 16, I can't be a criminal.	game/mansion.rpy	209	i "[what]"
Mansionuno_71774242	c	Hmm, I'm not sure if you're exempt from the law for being 16, bud.	game/mansion.rpy	210	c "[what]"
Mansionuno_c6f09f85	i	Well I didn't do anything wrong, really.	game/mansion.rpy	211	i "[what]"
Mansionuno_f032c9e1	i	Er, well, nothing {i}VERY{/i} wrong...	game/mansion.rpy	213	i "[what]"
Mansionuno_ac2f74b9_2	bi	...	game/mansion.rpy	214	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_f3ac3bf4	i	Well, {i}MAYBE{/i} very wrong, but-	game/mansion.rpy	220	i "[what]"
Mansionuno_dece8214	j	I think we get the point.	game/mansion.rpy	225	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_d6e9e466	j	Based on everyone's reaction, it seems like there's a least some truth to Dracula's point.	game/mansion.rpy	227	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_6d5fa770	j	I have some doubts though, especially considering Freddy's a literal child.	game/mansion.rpy	228	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_227f25aa	b	Yeah, it seems unlikely Freddy is a hardened criminal.	game/mansion.rpy	229	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_615e7a2c	bi	It's also hard for me to imagine Lauren or Jenny being a criminal...	game/mansion.rpy	230	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_bfd24144	bi	I wonder what they did...	game/mansion.rpy	231	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_78768862	d	Based on the lack of evidence against, it seems this conclusion is correct.	game/mansion.rpy	237	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_fad7d6b9	d	Surely anyone who didn't view themselves as a criminal could counter this argument.	game/mansion.rpy	238	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_ef6f2495	d	So it could be prudent to strategize around this information.	game/mansion.rpy	239	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_740e8315	t	Strategize how exactly?	game/mansion.rpy	243	t "[what]"
Mansionuno_5dc74097	d	Maybe we could each continue discussing reasons we could be here and try to find a common link.	game/mansion.rpy	244	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_6f08c46f	d	And by discussing reasons, I mean confess to our crimes.	game/mansion.rpy	245	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_d451e497	d	That common link could then help us identify the Game Master. The Game Master might even be the common link themselves.	game/mansion.rpy	246	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_f60fbcce	d	We'd be able to identify and eliminate them, ending this all.	game/mansion.rpy	247	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_6d0b15f8	d	For example, I've committed vampiric manslaughter.	game/mansion.rpy	249	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_34b6e0d0	d	I think it's unfair to call my need for sustenance a crime, but I digress.	game/mansion.rpy	250	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_7c2cc01b	bi	Common link? The few things people had admitted to definitely didn't have a common link. Was Dracula really this irrational?	game/mansion.rpy	253	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_c7d29af4	bi	No... I think I understood what Dracula was trying to do, but it was best not to say it out loud and he must know that.	game/mansion.rpy	254	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_ab54d843	bi	We already concluded there's a reasonable chance the murderer this round is tied to the mansion.	game/mansion.rpy	255	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_417cb126	bi	If people honestly admitted to their pasts, we could rule out suspects who hadn't been near this mansion.	game/mansion.rpy	256	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_bb6158b7	bi	But again, the murderer has no incentive to admit to a crime that could tie them to this location.	game/mansion.rpy	258	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_b623e92a	bi	So Dracula must be hoping the murderer isn't so wise.	game/mansion.rpy	259	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_7f3b19de	bi	Better yet, he's suggesting that the murderer's task, identifying and killing the Game Master, could be aided by this process.	game/mansion.rpy	260	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_eb9a5675	bi	If they took his words to heart, they would indirectly out themselves, and think that was the right thing to do...	game/mansion.rpy	261	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_6c217a1a	bi	But will Dracula's plan really work?	game/mansion.rpy	262	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_fa5b3328	t	Babe, you're just coming off as senile.	game/mansion.rpy	265	t "[what]"
Mansionuno_44c94561	t	The idea of admitting to our crimes would be much more enticing from a younger guy...	game/mansion.rpy	266	t "[what]"
Mansionuno_42b0cc5a	t	But we've already discussed this and it seems nobody else wants to speak up.	game/mansion.rpy	267	t "[what]"
Mansionuno_0d7b6cd0	d	Hmph, fine. Maybe this is a conversation that should wait for all of us to be present anyway.	game/mansion.rpy	268	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_6583002d	d	But, even if we don't admit to our crimes, maybe we should take precautions like mandatory travelling in pairs.	game/mansion.rpy	269	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_5d9694a0	t	Rubish!	game/mansion.rpy	275	t "[what]"
Mansionuno_7d6cbc2d	t	You see the room we're in? This is a palace made for a queen like me.	game/mansion.rpy	278	t "[what]"
Mansionuno_1ab354b6	t	There's bound to be plenty of high-class booze, stuff you'd find in VIP lounges.	game/mansion.rpy	279	t "[what]"
Mansionuno_6a850d47	b	For the first time since the start of all this, Stella makes a great point.	game/mansion.rpy	281	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_af47b19b	b	Hopefully there's some real food and sleeping arrangements...	game/mansion.rpy	282	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_37645f9b	t	I'm not going to let some geezer tell me what to do.	game/mansion.rpy	283	t "[what]"
Mansionuno_dabec3db	t	I worked hard my whole life to hire bodyguards, not to be one.	game/mansion.rpy	284	t "[what]"
Mansionuno_05c45a45	s	Again... you're kind of derailing the conversation here.	game/mansion.rpy	288	s "[what]"
Mansionuno_d7972b48	s	The point is that we have information, and we should use it to maximize our chance of escaping.	game/mansion.rpy	289	s "[what]"
Mansionuno_9de39a32	s	The particulars don't really matter, though I do think admitting our crimes might help.	game/mansion.rpy	290	s "[what]"
Mansionuno_ac2f74b9_3	bi	...	game/mansion.rpy	291	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_aa8b584d	bi	I don't want to think about it again.	game/mansion.rpy	292	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_4129a025	bi	I don't want to relive that moment.	game/mansion.rpy	293	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_dd8b797b	t	Honey, as someone who has confessed crimes, is that really fair when the vampire and pirate are going to keep playing pretend?	game/mansion.rpy	294	t "[what]"
Mansionuno_cd952ca1	h	What d'ye mean pretend? Ain't nothing pretend about me.	game/mansion.rpy	302	h "[what]"
Mansionuno_461bf795	t	Alright, if it means getting to see those abs, I can agree that you're a pirate.	game/mansion.rpy	305	t "[what]"
Mansionuno_ce861f58	h	Aye, that's what I like to hear!	game/mansion.rpy	308	h "[what]"
Mansionuno_56116ff2	j	I do have some concerns about us all admitting to crimes...	game/mansion.rpy	313	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_3a7fe033	j	I know it will sound suspicious, but I think for some of us, this very personal.	game/mansion.rpy	314	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_39167ade	j	One of those things that you have to keep bottled up or ignore for your own sanity.	game/mansion.rpy	315	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_af8d4c64	bi	Y-yeah.	game/mansion.rpy	316	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_21084db8	j	Like the awkward moment from middle school that ruins you when you think of it.	game/mansion.rpy	317	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_ac2f74b9_4	bi	...	game/mansion.rpy	318	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_d93910b2	t	I agree with the belle. I'm sure some of you have fetishes you wouldn't admit to, what makes a crime so different?	game/mansion.rpy	319	t "[what]"
Mansionuno_6b0e6c96	t	That being said, are you sure you aren't just trying to get on Bert's good side?	game/mansion.rpy	324	t "[what]"
Mansionuno_f911bd11	bi	Suddenly, all eyes were either on me or Jenny.	game/mansion.rpy	326	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_35ba70ca	b	What?	game/mansion.rpy	327	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_9fbca821	j	Huh?	game/mansion.rpy	329	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_8b86b6ed	t	What? You're both young, doe-eyed, happy types.	game/mansion.rpy	330	t "[what]"
Mansionuno_f4749204	t	And it's obvious Bert doesn't want to talk about his crime, so you're bailing him out.	game/mansion.rpy	331	t "[what]"
Mansionuno_138e3910	bi	Is she?	game/mansion.rpy	332	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_14841667	t	But hey, if you're not interested in Bert, I'll take him.	game/mansion.rpy	335	t "[what]"
Mansionuno_b4fa3fc0	j	...	game/mansion.rpy	336	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_850ef128	b	...	game/mansion.rpy	337	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_be6160c0	j	I'm just going to ignore what Stella said.	game/mansion.rpy	339	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_aeff0486	j	Anyways, I think talking about our crimes would create more sadness and distrust than anything.	game/mansion.rpy	344	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_cb4acbc5	j	Besides, look at the crimes we already know.	game/mansion.rpy	345	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_861fbf0d	j	Stella did some shady business deal, Sam dealt drugs, Bert's is something about driving.	game/mansion.rpy	346	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_52ef25a5	j	What common theme would those have that we could figure out?	game/mansion.rpy	347	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_daf9335f	blank	Nobody spoke up.	game/mansion.rpy	348	blank "[what]"
Mansionuno_3e80cb36	j	Exactly. So let's do something useful and explore this place.	game/mansion.rpy	349	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_09269caa	bi	I looked briefly at Sam and Dracula.	game/mansion.rpy	350	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_e1554201	s	...	game/mansion.rpy	357	s "[what]"
Mansionuno_1523fe20	d	...	game/mansion.rpy	358	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_c1f6ba23	bi	Looks like that's the end of that conversation.	game/mansion.rpy	359	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_6ca03cbc	d	Well, one more thing.	game/mansion.rpy	364	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_51e4e5b0	d	It seems that despite not being in a fast-moving train, escape is unlikely.	game/mansion.rpy	365	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_5729531f	d	All the windows in this room have been boarded with a metal sheet...	game/mansion.rpy	366	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_11b6e40b	d	Even if they were not there, I have a feeling the chips in our brains would likely kill us if we escaped.	game/mansion.rpy	367	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_cd14b979	d	And, given what happened to Kaiser, it would seem the chips are going to be hard to subvert.	game/mansion.rpy	368	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_ba124227	d	That is all I wished to say. Would hate to see any more unnecessary deaths than we already have.	game/mansion.rpy	369	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_eb0243f6	i	So um, are we free to go explore?	game/mansion.rpy	372	i "[what]"
Mansionuno_0418030b	i	I... I've never been in a house this fancy.	game/mansion.rpy	373	i "[what]"
Mansionuno_3906db81	i	I was hoping we'd do what we did on the train and get to explore a bit.	game/mansion.rpy	374	i "[what]"
Mansionuno_0ed3c219	c	Great idea Sid!	game/mansion.rpy	380	c "[what]"
Mansionuno_52f695f0	c	There's bound to be some new information here we can use.	game/mansion.rpy	381	c "[what]"
Mansionuno_405b8ccd	ses	Mrow!	game/mansion.rpy	382	ses "[what]"
Mansionuno_8e837cc6	c	Oh, true, and maybe mice to catch!	game/mansion.rpy	383	c "[what]"
Mansionuno_2868969b	bi	She's as scatterbrained as usual, but it's probably good right now.	game/mansion.rpy	385	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_44db19f3	bi	Sid is probably the most shaken up about Dan's death. It's good to get his mind off that.	game/mansion.rpy	386	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_a50ff4d2	b	Yeah, plus we have to figure out what there is to eat and where to sleep.	game/mansion.rpy	387	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_7cdb3dfd	bi	I'd be happy to get my mind off it for a bit too.	game/mansion.rpy	388	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_78f76c4e	bi	I approached Jenny and made sure Stella wasn't within earshot.	game/mansion.rpy	394	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_c598c965	b	Hey Jenny, want to explore together?	game/mansion.rpy	395	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_07b8adc7	j	Oh?	game/mansion.rpy	396	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_d441fd32	j	Sure!	game/mansion.rpy	398	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_967d5c19	bi	I think after how she helped on train, I can trust her.	game/mansion.rpy	399	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_bc71e4e5	bi	Was Stella actually on to something about Jenny and I? I'm not sure...	game/mansion.rpy	400	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_c90600ee	j	Where should we start? This is quite the upgrade from that trian!	game/mansion.rpy	401	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_f7781dc2	bi	The others left as we started talking.	game/mansion.rpy	403	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_7941a14b	b	Guess no one wants to look around here?	game/mansion.rpy	404	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_34fb8a8b	j	Maybe they thought they saw everything.	game/mansion.rpy	406	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_09875b0c	j	And to be fair, there isn't much to see.	game/mansion.rpy	407	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_d389d3d6	j	A large dining table, some furniture...	game/mansion.rpy	408	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_89d39c1f	j	There is that ominous portrait, though.	game/mansion.rpy	409	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_5faa3aec	bi	She pointed above the fireplace.	game/mansion.rpy	410	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_5e035e97	bi	A middle-aged, ordinary-looking man dressed up quite nicely.	game/mansion.rpy	411	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_7335d576	b	Wait... who is that?	game/mansion.rpy	412	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_092c521e	j	No clue.	game/mansion.rpy	413	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_1c5e4aec	b	It must be someone relevant, right?	game/mansion.rpy	414	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_30a04129	b	Unless the Game Master just took someone's mansion without a problem.	game/mansion.rpy	415	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_dfa9ded1	b	But it seems like anyone rich enough to own this house wouldn't be so easily... overcome?	game/mansion.rpy	416	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_4d926983	b	Surely they could afford some top notch security or would have police trying to help them retake their mansion non-stop.	game/mansion.rpy	417	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_9eba4cea	j	You might be onto something.	game/mansion.rpy	418	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_0f1e58d4	j	Maybe it's the Game Master? And this is their mansion?	game/mansion.rpy	419	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_2f2ecd5f	b	Well, that would contradict what the screen told us about one of us being the Game Master.	game/mansion.rpy	420	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_e8cafdcc	b	But maybe we'd be naive to trust that.	game/mansion.rpy	422	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_327c1e59	j	Unless someone's met this person before, I don't know if we'll get much information out of this.	game/mansion.rpy	423	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_e4215550	j	Let's look somewhere else. Looks like this room connects to the kitchen and a bedroom.	game/mansion.rpy	424	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_745eb099	b	Let's head to the kitchen, I'm hungry!	game/mansion.rpy	426	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_195391a9	l	Hey, what happened in the other room? Heard lots of chatter.	game/mansion.rpy	431	l "[what]"
Mansionuno_1eeb60c3	b	Well uh...	game/mansion.rpy	433	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_f5e816da	bi	I'm pretty curious how she'll react to the whole, "we're all criminals" news.	game/mansion.rpy	434	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_04301aa2	b	we've concluded everyone here's a uh, criminal, basically.	game/mansion.rpy	435	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_ee9a3402	b	Some people suggested we all admit to our crime, but that wasn't very well received.	game/mansion.rpy	436	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_0b40dfec	l	Ah, okay. Well, good news, the kitchen is rather well-stocked.	game/mansion.rpy	437	l "[what]"
Mansionuno_92e1df66	bi	.....	game/mansion.rpy	439	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_beca2484	bi	... is she not at all fazed by the fact that we're all criminals?	game/mansion.rpy	440	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_3dad8afe	l	Basically what you'd expect from a kitchen in a mansion!	game/mansion.rpy	442	l "[what]"
Mansionuno_1eac142b	l	Plenty of tools, cutlery, and cookware.	game/mansion.rpy	443	l "[what]"
Mansionuno_46fefb4d	l	Though there seems to be only one knife...	game/mansion.rpy	444	l "[what]"
Mansionuno_1862cfb5	l	Maybe the Game Master didn't want a knife murder to be too easy?	game/mansion.rpy	445	l "[what]"
Mansionuno_7bfb8882	l	Regardless, there's also all sorts of meats and veggies, the stove, fridge, and freezer all functioning, tap water...	game/mansion.rpy	446	l "[what]"
Mansionuno_9459a1f6	h	I heard fridge and freezer. Is there rum fer the takin'?	game/mansion.rpy	453	h "[what]"
Mansionuno_42c934bf	t	If the mansion's owner has any class, there should be.	game/mansion.rpy	454	t "[what]"
Mansionuno_82822a0c	l	...	game/mansion.rpy	459	l "[what]"
Mansionuno_5b9391f3	l	Hey Freddy, Shahar and Stella want a chance to check out the kitchen, maybe let's not disturb them.	game/mansion.rpy	460	l "[what]"
Mansionuno_a89f3a42	b	We could just ask them to-	game/mansion.rpy	461	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_24f0f4b7	l	It's easier to just not bother, honestly.	game/mansion.rpy	462	l "[what]"
Mansionuno_197bb039	b	True. By the way, some people brought up the idea of sleeping arrangements.	game/mansion.rpy	463	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_9f93f0d2	l	Oooo, Freddy, wanna go claim a bed?	game/mansion.rpy	464	l "[what]"
Mansionuno_ee199d66	f	O-okay!	game/mansion.rpy	470	f "[what]"
Mansionuno_ceedec94	h	Rum, vodka, mead, they have ev'rything here!	game/mansion.rpy	479	h "[what]"
Mansionuno_f2b87365	t	Tequila shots! It's been so long. Bert, Jenny, want to join us?	game/mansion.rpy	480	t "[what]"
Mansionuno_b4e93209	j	I'm... not old enough to drink yet.	game/mansion.rpy	484	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_8bc54c8c	t	Who's gonna arrest you? The Game Master who's already broken twenty different laws?	game/mansion.rpy	485	t "[what]"
Mansionuno_2682b525	t	Plus it'd be good for you and Bert to get to know each other with your inhibitions down.	game/mansion.rpy	487	t "[what]"
Mansionuno_82989243	b	Alright, I think we've seen everything we need to see here.	game/mansion.rpy	488	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_561c41dc	b	Jenny, let's go check out another room.	game/mansion.rpy	490	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_058f271d	t	A bedroom?	game/mansion.rpy	494	t "[what]"
Mansionuno_f0e49aa4	j	Jeez, get me out of here.	game/mansion.rpy	496	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_7174fb60	c	Hey guys! Welcome to Catherine's Garage Emporium!	game/mansion.rpy	503	c "[what]"
Mansionuno_9f9ba28f	b	Catherine's Garage Emporium?	game/mansion.rpy	505	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_341bedd4	c	Just something I made up, haha.	game/mansion.rpy	506	c "[what]"
Mansionuno_9aebe9b6	c	There's no car, otherwise we could make a sick getaway!	game/mansion.rpy	507	c "[what]"
Mansionuno_e9651826	c	Well, you know, minus the whole chip in our head thing.	game/mansion.rpy	509	c "[what]"
Mansionuno_6180e3ec	c	Also the garage door doesn't open, though it's not surprising.	game/mansion.rpy	510	c "[what]"
Mansionuno_dc6539a6	c	In better news, there's some rope here Sesame can use as a scratching toy!	game/mansion.rpy	512	c "[what]"
Mansionuno_570fa53f	s	{i}Scrichhhh{/i}.	game/mansion.rpy	513	s "[what]"
Mansionuno_3ba30aa2	c	He's having fun with it already!	game/mansion.rpy	514	c "[what]"
Mansionuno_23623ac1	b	Wow, maybe Sesame can scratch his way out of here for us!	game/mansion.rpy	515	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_d12c2df2	c	What? Don't be silly. That's completely unreasonable.	game/mansion.rpy	516	c "[what]"
Mansionuno_518bff02	bi	.	game/mansion.rpy	517	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_d23b0bd2	c	There's also some simple tools and supplies in here.	game/mansion.rpy	518	c "[what]"
Mansionuno_a90604d7	c	We've got a drill, a hammer and nails, a screwdriver and screws, a stepstool, and some batteries.	game/mansion.rpy	519	c "[what]"
Mansionuno_03cb2cf1	c	We could use these to repair anything that breaks, maybe?	game/mansion.rpy	520	c "[what]"
Mansionuno_0d111eb7	c	Not sure if anyone here's much of handyman though.	game/mansion.rpy	521	c "[what]"
Mansionuno_0c0d5bb8	i	I... I could repair things around here.	game/mansion.rpy	527	i "[what]"
Mansionuno_0f23e650	i	We couldn't afford to hire people, so my dad taught me how to do basic household repairs.	game/mansion.rpy	528	i "[what]"
Mansionuno_e5364fc8	c	That's nice of you to offer Sid!	game/mansion.rpy	529	c "[what]"
Mansionuno_7c9b4503	c	But hopefully the need doesn't arise.	game/mansion.rpy	530	c "[what]"
Mansionuno_369d746b	c	There's also a clock and some boxes full of junk.	game/mansion.rpy	531	c "[what]"
Mansionuno_a0a1cdf3	c	According to the clock it's early afternoon right now.	game/mansion.rpy	532	c "[what]"
Mansionuno_57762e73	b	It's hard to tell for sure, with all the windows boarded up.	game/mansion.rpy	533	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_2d2b51fd	b	We might as well use that as our time standard for now.	game/mansion.rpy	534	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_e6fcb3da	c	Catherine's Garage Emporium Standard time! CGEST!	game/mansion.rpy	536	c "[what]"
Mansionuno_c0be546e	bi	I heard Jenny giggle behind me. I'm jealous of their lightheardedness sometimes...	game/mansion.rpy	538	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_cfae006c	c	There's also a light generator here, it seems like it's fully fueled.	game/mansion.rpy	543	c "[what]"
Mansionuno_c36c39e2	c	We have running power so we shouldn't need it, but it's nice to know that won't be an issue.	game/mansion.rpy	544	c "[what]"
Mansionuno_45fd096c	b	Yeah, the lights were on in the dining room, and the fridge and freeze are running.	game/mansion.rpy	551	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_df8260cc	b	So I don't think we'll need to worry about that.	game/mansion.rpy	552	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_7f4d35e7	c	Oh, nice! Do you happen to know if the kitchen is well stocked?	game/mansion.rpy	554	c "[what]"
Mansionuno_ca685913	c	I used to work as a sous-chef in a kitchen, I could whip us up some nice meals.	game/mansion.rpy	555	c "[what]"
Mansionuno_9b7cd225	c	Don't have to be vegetarian meals, wouldn't want the meat to go to waste.	game/mansion.rpy	557	c "[what]"
Mansionuno_1e6a3aee	b	Wow, thats awesome of you to offer!	game/mansion.rpy	558	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_6a40e87a	j	Hmmm... Catherine, if you're going to cook, I have an idea.	game/mansion.rpy	567	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_b16bc472	c	Send it at me!	game/mansion.rpy	568	c "[what]"
Mansionuno_78482e09	j	Well, I think what we all really need right now is something to bring us together.	game/mansion.rpy	569	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_1990ddfa	b	Something to bring us together?	game/mansion.rpy	570	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_0b3b3593	j	Yeah, like... a fancy dinner party!	game/mansion.rpy	577	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_948ce149	c	Aww, Jenny! That's such a cute idea!	game/mansion.rpy	579	c "[what]"
Mansionuno_13a9487a	c	Yes, let's do it!	game/mansion.rpy	580	c "[what]"
Mansionuno_0f1e7993	c	We'd probably need at least a day to prepare, so it would have to be tomorrow evening.	game/mansion.rpy	581	c "[what]"
Mansionuno_51e07358	j	That should be fine, and we can all chip in to help!	game/mansion.rpy	582	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_ef6bfbf6	i	Wow, a fancy party?	game/mansion.rpy	587	i "[what]"
Mansionuno_a45dca03	i	I... I've only ever lived in my parents' cramped apartment.	game/mansion.rpy	588	i "[what]"
Mansionuno_44d90fdc	i	Sustaining ourselves off budget meals.	game/mansion.rpy	589	i "[what]"
Mansionuno_825d2dc6	i	This is...	game/mansion.rpy	590	i "[what]"
Mansionuno_5c989c70	i	So exciting!	game/mansion.rpy	597	i "[what]"
Mansionuno_e3a4c61d	bi	Wow, and just like that, Sid's in high spirits.	game/mansion.rpy	598	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_288ad035	b	Sounds good to me!	game/mansion.rpy	599	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_86bf42af	bi	Honestly, anything to get Sid's mind off of Dan, and this situation as a whole, is welcome in my book.	game/mansion.rpy	602	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_2122dfcc	bi	I'm glad something good is coming out of this.	game/mansion.rpy	614	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_e98f0217	b	Ready to keep exploring?	game/mansion.rpy	621	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_af3293cd	j	Sounds good, Catherine gave us a rundown of this room anyway.	game/mansion.rpy	622	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_0d434464	j	Let's see... We saw the dining room, kitchen, and garage.	game/mansion.rpy	623	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_1aa11a43	j	It seems like we've explored the entirety of this floor, so let's go upstairs?	game/mansion.rpy	624	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_1d8e2dfb	b	Sure.	game/mansion.rpy	625	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_6218151e	j	Okay, so this is the upstairs, huh?	game/mansion.rpy	632	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_8bd9c196	b	Prety spacious.	game/mansion.rpy	633	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_891fd107	j	It seems like there are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 doors up here!	game/mansion.rpy	634	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_5e2092da	j	Let's check them out from left to right!	game/mansion.rpy	635	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_f1f47c37	b	I hear some murmuring coming from that room already...	game/mansion.rpy	636	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_03490c3a	b	Maybe don't-	game/mansion.rpy	638	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_a14a63c3	j	Wahoo!	game/mansion.rpy	639	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_cfb2a721	b	-barge in...	game/mansion.rpy	642	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_119eccd7	b	The master bedroom?	game/mansion.rpy	647	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_150954cd	d	Good of you to join us.	game/mansion.rpy	653	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_1bf3c480	d	Sam and I were just chatting. There's nothing particularly interesting here.	game/mansion.rpy	654	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_be52a3c6	d	Just a fancy bedroom, befitting for an old accomplished vampire.	game/mansion.rpy	655	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_feb07572	s	Subtle attempt to make an early claim on the nicest room.	game/mansion.rpy	656	s "[what]"
Mansionuno_46cc7f1d	s	Sure you're not just saying that because your joints are giving out?	game/mansion.rpy	657	s "[what]"
Mansionuno_b816d149	d	Hmph, make age jokes if you must.	game/mansion.rpy	658	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_3b94c0d0	d	But being a vampire means that despite my age, I am quite nimble.	game/mansion.rpy	659	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_8ea60c9b	d	Also may I remind you, I don't need to sleep.	game/mansion.rpy	660	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_07f9dfd5	d	...but if I am to spend the night thinking, this room seems ideal to do so.	game/mansion.rpy	661	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_7d1ad625	b	Before deciding where people will sleeps... or stay awake, do we know what the other living arrangements are?	game/mansion.rpy	662	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_aea51116	s	There are four bedrooms, including this master bedroom.	game/mansion.rpy	663	s "[what]"
Mansionuno_792bf4bb	b	So enough for eight of us to sleep on a bed, if people are willing to share.	game/mansion.rpy	664	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_5093737d	d	Unfortunately, besides this room, it seems the beds will only fit one adult.	game/mansion.rpy	665	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_ac315b89	d	Fortunately, the couches in the living room seem rather comfy.	game/mansion.rpy	666	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_4035371d	b	Okay, I think in thirty minutes or so we should meet up and decide this like we did in the train.	game/mansion.rpy	667	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_4f797979	b	With a vote, rather than someone making an early claim.	game/mansion.rpy	668	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_ef34dba0	d	Hmph.	game/mansion.rpy	669	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_f39b4a0c	d	Fine.	game/mansion.rpy	670	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_5691c39e	b	Cool, make sure to mention it to anyone you bump into.	game/mansion.rpy	671	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_744f5ced	b	By the way, can I ask what you were talking about?	game/mansion.rpy	672	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_1523fe20_1	d	...	game/mansion.rpy	674	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_e1554201_1	s	...	game/mansion.rpy	675	s "[what]"
Mansionuno_90a06185	d	We were discussing private affairs.	game/mansion.rpy	676	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_44699085	d	You have secrets you're keeping about your crime, so surely you won't mind me keeping my own.	game/mansion.rpy	677	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_6f5437de	s	Yeah, what the vampire said.	game/mansion.rpy	678	s "[what]"
Mansionuno_2fe80f2f	b	Oh, yeah, of course...	game/mansion.rpy	679	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_21c8b3b7	d	And maybe you'd like to give us some privacy so we may continue speaking?	game/mansion.rpy	681	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_2bb6992b	d	Continue going on your little adventure around the house.	game/mansion.rpy	682	d "[what]"
Mansionuno_0d0e9b36	bi	I nodded, but was a little bit annoyed by the whole conversation.	game/mansion.rpy	683	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_ee877453	b	Let's move on? We can check the next room over.	game/mansion.rpy	688	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_522253e7	j	Sounds good.	game/mansion.rpy	689	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_c1b26313	l	Oh, hey guys.	game/mansion.rpy	698	l "[what]"
Mansionuno_42ae6094	l	I thought bouncing on a bed might get Freddy's mind off things.	game/mansion.rpy	700	l "[what]"
Mansionuno_596d7565	f	It's fun!	game/mansion.rpy	706	f "[what]"
Mansionuno_3bfa7559	l	It's probably not what he's used to in terms of fun but... it's something.	game/mansion.rpy	707	l "[what]"
Mansionuno_9f1487f1	b	By the way, we're meeting soon in the living room to discuss who gets to sleep where.	game/mansion.rpy	709	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_6056fc1d	b	We can bring you down with us when it's time to start.	game/mansion.rpy	710	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_9101d2b3	l	Got it.	game/mansion.rpy	711	l "[what]"
Mansionuno_a31763f0	b	Do you mind if we look around here?	game/mansion.rpy	712	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_7101258b	l	Sure, don't mind us.	game/mansion.rpy	713	l "[what]"
Mansionuno_9fa66414	j	Huh. Looks like they weren't lying about having only small beds outside of the master bedroom.	game/mansion.rpy	718	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_2454999d	b	Yeah, it's very weird for how luxurious the house is otherwise.	game/mansion.rpy	719	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_7e57c65f	b	The room isn't particularly well furnished either.	game/mansion.rpy	720	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_3081a344	b	Normally there'd be a dresser or something like that in here.	game/mansion.rpy	721	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_99f82f9d	j	Hm... maybe the Game Master is trying to minimize how many spots things can be hidden in?	game/mansion.rpy	722	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_ae9e68d7	j	After all, searching four fully furnished bedrooms sounds like a chore.	game/mansion.rpy	723	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_9efa0987	b	That'd be awfully considerate for someone who, you know, wants most of us dead.	game/mansion.rpy	724	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_78cf6742	j	That's true. But if they wanted us dead, why not just kill us instead of making us play this game?	game/mansion.rpy	725	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_1eb165bc	b	I wish I knew.	game/mansion.rpy	726	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_e03a3c1a	j	If you say so.	game/mansion.rpy	727	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_1511d0c6	b	...Next room?	game/mansion.rpy	728	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_fcceffc0	j	Yeah.	game/mansion.rpy	729	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_c5177907	j	Hey Bert, ummm...	game/mansion.rpy	740	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_a1a3df0a	j	While we're alone...	game/mansion.rpy	741	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_777afd5d	j	Do the jokes everyone's making about us annoy you as much as they annoy me?	game/mansion.rpy	747	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_0adf37db	b	I don't get how people can be saying that kind of stuff while our lives are on the line.	game/mansion.rpy	749	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_83e6dc4c	j	Okay, just wanted to make sure we were on the same page.	game/mansion.rpy	750	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_76ac3b10	b	I'll speak up next time it happens.	game/mansion.rpy	752	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_3387f072	b	..and you should join me in doing so, since I don't think they all take me seriously.	game/mansion.rpy	753	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_6b705023	b	Mostly Dracula, since I'm not admitting my crime.	game/mansion.rpy	754	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_aa427cd2	b	Even though he's still claiming to be a vampire...	game/mansion.rpy	755	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_07b5cb00	j	Don't worry about him. He's just a grumpy boomer.	game/mansion.rpy	757	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_35a6c72a	j	He thinks that since he's stuck here with a bunch of "young" people he's in charge.	game/mansion.rpy	758	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_2e825da3	j	You don't need to tell anyone what your crime is, I wasn't just saying that to protect you.	game/mansion.rpy	759	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_0e257fa1	j	I think that applies to everyone.	game/mansion.rpy	760	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_6bc2d51b	j	Even if someone sharing our crimes could help us...	game/mansion.rpy	761	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_5015a342	j	I really do think revealing our crimes will just drive in unnecessary wedges.	game/mansion.rpy	762	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_850ef128_1	b	...	game/mansion.rpy	763	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_a2fda487	bi	I do feel close and comfortable with Jenny, though.	game/mansion.rpy	764	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_906724b5	bi	She has an air about her that's just feels... safe.	game/mansion.rpy	765	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_98932e28	bi	Should I... open up to her?	game/mansion.rpy	769	bi "[what]" nointeract
Mansionuno_f754dca8	b	I agree, but... maybe I could tell you mine?	game/mansion.rpy	773	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_07b8adc7_1	j	Oh?	game/mansion.rpy	774	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_bf2724e2	b	It might help move this all forward.	game/mansion.rpy	775	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_5bf51059	b	And... maybe if it's off my chest I won't have to think about it anymore while we're here.	game/mansion.rpy	776	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_c2f12166	bi	I shivered a bit at the thought of speaking about it again.	game/mansion.rpy	777	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_c5494650	bi	It seems like Jenny saw me look a little shaken up.	game/mansion.rpy	778	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_8d649182	b	Yeah, you're right.	game/mansion.rpy	783	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_15ac4c20	bi	I shivered a bit at the thought of talking about it again.	game/mansion.rpy	784	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_c5494650_1	bi	It seems like Jenny saw me look a little shaken up.	game/mansion.rpy	785	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_9eb9c76f	j	Well, I can tell you mine, if you want.	game/mansion.rpy	787	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_54a2f2c4	j	If it makes you more comfortable with me.	game/mansion.rpy	788	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_c02b6d68	j	It's not that bad, if anything I'm a little proud of it.	game/mansion.rpy	790	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_ac2f74b9_5	bi	...	game/mansion.rpy	791	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_4014d979	bi	Jenny had been so bubbly and supportive this whole time.	game/mansion.rpy	792	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_cb77514c	bi	It's hard to process that she's a criminal too.	game/mansion.rpy	794	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_8b0c966d	b	Sure, we can trade secrets.	game/mansion.rpy	796	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_53d71353	j	Okay.	game/mansion.rpy	797	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_f4892de0	j	A few years ago there was a pretty popular court case in trial near me.	game/mansion.rpy	798	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_4e4a0ee6	j	An infamous sleazeball businessman was caught for a whole ton of stuff.	game/mansion.rpy	799	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_72d1a049	j	He was pretty well known, had his hand in the a lot of our city's happenings.	game/mansion.rpy	800	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_a8dc1b15	j	Anyway, my friends and I would go hang around at town hall when it was in trial.	game/mansion.rpy	801	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_1fbe8d49	j	We wanted to pressure the jury to rule guilty however we could, even if we were just watching.	game/mansion.rpy	802	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_84b457cd	j	From day one it was so clear he was guilty.	game/mansion.rpy	803	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_45df2d8a	j	And I mean, guilty guilty.	game/mansion.rpy	804	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_7b81f71b	j	They had several eye witnesses for tons of different crimes.	game/mansion.rpy	805	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_edf42a95	j	And then guess what happened?	game/mansion.rpy	806	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_6f352d16	b	I'm... kinda scared to know.	game/mansion.rpy	807	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_ed17ca9a	j	He was found not guilty, walked out with not even a slap on the wrist.	game/mansion.rpy	808	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_433b11d4	j	Everyone at townhall went ballistic... it was the craziest thing I've ever seen.	game/mansion.rpy	809	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_2691c8d6	j	People started screaming, fighting, crying.	game/mansion.rpy	810	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_a1d8cbc5	j	And ya know, I've always been a bit of a loudmouth...	game/mansion.rpy	811	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_47181050	j	I may or may not have... screamed some choice words at the judge and jury.	game/mansion.rpy	812	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_0a9c445a	b	It's hard to picture you that upset.	game/mansion.rpy	813	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_d9ea05c0	j	They must have been bribed or something, and I was so mad and didn't control myself...	game/mansion.rpy	814	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_cf47fbbe	j	I got dragged away in handcuffs.	game/mansion.rpy	815	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_94c3488f	j	I didn't think what I did was that bad, but it was all just for show, really.	game/mansion.rpy	816	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_67c2f969	b	For show?	game/mansion.rpy	817	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_5aaf2df2	j	Yeah, they made a big deal out of my case to distract from the original not guilty verdict.	game/mansion.rpy	818	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_bc2ba377	j	"Local Pink Haired Girl Threatens to Kill Judge" was all over the city.	game/mansion.rpy	820	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_a0cb4ffa	b	You threatened to kill him?!	game/mansion.rpy	821	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_a478c700	j	I mean, a little yes, a little no. It's hard to remember.	game/mansion.rpy	822	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_4554fe18	j	But yeah, that's been following me ever since.	game/mansion.rpy	823	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_e30a1ad5	j	To think I got off worse than that bastard did, it's crazy.	game/mansion.rpy	824	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_d9ffca90	j	It was a dumb decision, but honestly?	game/mansion.rpy	826	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_24768838	j	I don't regret it much. I'm kinda proud.	game/mansion.rpy	828	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_b41822c7	j	It's important to stand up for what's right!	game/mansion.rpy	833	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_fa82d418	bi	It definitely sounds like something she'd do.	game/mansion.rpy	834	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_ae2ecbc0	j	That's my crime, if you want to call it that.	game/mansion.rpy	836	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_11086771	bi	Maybe I should just tell her.	game/mansion.rpy	839	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_2e56167a	bi	Jenny opening up definitely took some edge off.	game/mansion.rpy	840	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_9039e81c	b	I can tell you mine, too.	game/mansion.rpy	841	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_07b8adc7_2	j	Oh?	game/mansion.rpy	842	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_f8355672	j	Only if you want to.	game/mansion.rpy	843	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_3bb5a1ed	b	I do.	game/mansion.rpy	844	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_4fced976	bi	Wow, my heart's racing.	game/mansion.rpy	845	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_82a68a2a	b	Okay. My turn.	game/mansion.rpy	847	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_4fced976_1	bi	Wow, my heart's racing.	game/mansion.rpy	848	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_c434d8c6	b	Mine's much less... exciting?	game/mansion.rpy	849	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_5ac4a741	b	I was 17, driving home after tutoring.	game/mansion.rpy	850	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_d3231cfd	b	This lady was walking on the sidewalk and suddenly walked into the road, without looking...	game/mansion.rpy	852	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_9ab32a54	b	The next light was green, so I was going pretty fast, and had barely any time to react.	game/mansion.rpy	853	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_fb5571a5	b	And... well, I ran into her.	game/mansion.rpy	854	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_09a72b05	b	She didn't make it...	game/mansion.rpy	855	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_c9c965f8	b	Fortunately, I had a dashcam with footage that convinced the court to let me off.	game/mansion.rpy	856	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_be8064d3	b	But it still haunted me... even if I was legally fine, should I have been driving slower?	game/mansion.rpy	857	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_b56a63f7	b	If I was paying more attention, would I have reacted sooner?	game/mansion.rpy	858	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_c9537c80	b	I... moved after that, not wanting to be near that city or that memory.	game/mansion.rpy	859	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_b2a0f652	b	Moved somewhere where I could take the train to work.	game/mansion.rpy	860	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_77318ec1	b	Haven't driven since.	game/mansion.rpy	861	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_b4fa3fc0_1	j	...	game/mansion.rpy	863	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_5cee8e21	j	I'm so sorry you went through that.	game/mansion.rpy	864	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_e6fd09fc	j	Thank you for telling me. I won't tell anyone else.	game/mansion.rpy	865	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_c69b0a36	j	We don't have to talk about this more if you don't want to.	game/mansion.rpy	866	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_ce19a74a	b	Yeah, I'd appreciate that.	game/mansion.rpy	867	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_850ef128_2	b	...	game/mansion.rpy	868	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_b4fa3fc0_2	j	...	game/mansion.rpy	869	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_7aca1747	b	Umm, there isn't much to explore in here...	game/mansion.rpy	870	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_fb6a55c7	j	Oh, yeah, exploring.	game/mansion.rpy	871	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_4b5f9ac9	j	It's almost like a hotel; this room is nearly identical to the other bedroom.	game/mansion.rpy	872	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_ae883dbb	b	We might as well peek into the last bedroom.	game/mansion.rpy	873	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_01adabc3	j	Mhm.	game/mansion.rpy	874	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_90c4ec64	bi	We checked the last bedroom door.	game/mansion.rpy	876	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_1eb98489	bi	It seemed to be identical to the previous two rooms.	game/mansion.rpy	877	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_46a77bee	j	Alright! So three basic bedrooms, and one master bedroom.	game/mansion.rpy	882	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_7a399095	j	That leaves 2 more doors up here.	game/mansion.rpy	883	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_e51f1a01	j	First up is this closet door...	game/mansion.rpy	884	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_88e9b611	b	Let's see what's inside.	game/mansion.rpy	885	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_a50ff47f	bi	I tried to open the closet door. It was locked.	game/mansion.rpy	886	bi "[what]"
Mansionuno_0c854ce1	b	It won't open...	game/mansion.rpy	887	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_2e2a2566	b	Last time there was a closet that was locked, it wasn't good news.	game/mansion.rpy	889	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_6d80d79a	j	Nothing we can do about it besides keep an eye on it though.	game/mansion.rpy	890	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_35eaf968	b	Yeah, guess not.	game/mansion.rpy	891	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_193e5e01	j	I guess that just leaves the bathroom.	game/mansion.rpy	893	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_2a7fbb9d	j	Um... you mind checking that out without me?	game/mansion.rpy	894	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_6dc81c3d	b	Why's that?	game/mansion.rpy	895	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_7fd8b628	j	Well, it's a bathroom.	game/mansion.rpy	896	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_3bf7126f	b	You make a good point.	game/mansion.rpy	897	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_a1fb6832	j	I'll go grab Lauren and Freddy so we can go to the meeting.	game/mansion.rpy	898	j "[what]"
Mansionuno_15141ce0	b	Sounds good.	game/mansion.rpy	899	b "[what]"
Mansionuno_c6fba5dd	bi	I headed to the bathroom by myself.	game/mansion.rpy	900	bi "[what]"
mansion1_495cc79d	b	So uh...	game/mansion.rpy	905	b "[what]"
mansion1_17d98f38	b	Guess this is the bathroom.	game/mansion.rpy	906	b "[what]"
mansion1_4f30d40c	bi	...who am I talking to?	game/mansion.rpy	907	bi "[what]"
mansion1_19c80c81	bi	It's just me in here.	game/mansion.rpy	908	bi "[what]"
mansion1_2a002eb5	bi	This is the nicest bathroom I've been in, I think.	game/mansion.rpy	909	bi "[what]"
mansion1_80333717	bi	Even some of the hotel bathrooms I've been in weren't quite this nice.	game/mansion.rpy	910	bi "[what]"
mansion1_d1fa43f9	bi	There's so much space, the largest bathroom mirror I've ever seen.	game/mansion.rpy	911	bi "[what]"
mansion1_e658f217	bi	More drawers than I can even think of a use for...	game/mansion.rpy	912	bi "[what]"
mansion1_d093448e	bi	I think the knobs on the faucet and in the tub are gold-plated...	game/mansion.rpy	913	bi "[what]"
mansion1_0a7b7ce4	bi	And this huge mirror.	game/mansion.rpy	916	bi "[what]"
mansion1_b108f0c4	bi	Man, looking at myself, I feel like I've aged 20 years in the past few days.	game/mansion.rpy	917	bi "[what]"
mansion1_bbbf494c	bi	This is such a terrifying situation, but...	game/mansion.rpy	918	bi "[what]"
mansion1_e206e80c	bi	I'm hopeful we can get everyone on the same page and keep everyone alive.	game/mansion.rpy	925	bi "[what]"
mansion1_f2a90ebc	bi	Especially with news of this party we're going to throw.	game/mansion.rpy	926	bi "[what]"
mansion1_a03c8892	bi	Maybe It'll give us a chance to chat with people and learn more about our situation.	game/mansion.rpy	927	bi "[what]"
mansion1_1936e608	bi	...Well, I'm done admiring this bathroom.	game/mansion.rpy	930	bi "[what]"
mansion1_3de83cca	bi	Time to head downstairs for the meeting.	game/mansion.rpy	931	bi "[what]"
mansion1_4a08112d	b	It's kinda spooky in here with most of the lights off...	game/mansion.rpy	937	b "[what]"
mansion1_f2c245fa	s	So Bert, you called this meeting, right?	game/mansion.rpy	939	s "[what]"
mansion1_947ab8e2	b	Yeah, mostly to discuss the sleeping arrangements, though Catherine might have an announcement too?	game/mansion.rpy	940	b "[what]"
mansion1_3283549f	c	Yessir! But I'll wait until you're done Bert.	game/mansion.rpy	947	c "[what]"
mansion1_f514cef1	b	Alright. So there's four bedrooms upstairs, each with a twin bed, except the master bedroom that has a bigger bed.	game/mansion.rpy	949	b "[what]"
mansion1_a1126712	b	So five of us can sleep pretty easily.	game/mansion.rpy	950	b "[what]"
mansion1_3f3874d8	l	For what it's worth, Freddy can probably fit in a twin bed with someone, if both Freddy and that person don't mind.	game/mansion.rpy	954	l "[what]"
mansion1_8b38e11e	l	Freddy, that sound okay to you?	game/mansion.rpy	955	l "[what]"
mansion1_41994856	f	Yeah, okay with me!	game/mansion.rpy	959	f "[what]"
mansion1_f30df59c	f	Can Lauren be the person I share a bed with?	game/mansion.rpy	964	f "[what]"
mansion1_9ca4e092	l	Never thought you'd ask.	game/mansion.rpy	967	l "[what]"
mansion1_a95d5828	bi	I could've guessed that...	game/mansion.rpy	968	bi "[what]"
mansion1_07806bc5	b	Okay, so three of us need to stay somewhere that isn't a bedroom.	game/mansion.rpy	970	b "[what]"
mansion1_7598edad	b	And two people can probably share the master bedroom.	game/mansion.rpy	971	b "[what]"
mansion1_70af91a6	t	Any young guys want to share the master bedroom with me?	game/mansion.rpy	976	t "[what]"
mansion1_272e77ec	t	I think we'd make the best use of it, if you catch my drift.	game/mansion.rpy	977	t "[what]"
mansion1_116a6b14	l	Your libido isn't a valid reason to give you that room.	game/mansion.rpy	981	l "[what]"
mansion1_035a8e67	t	Fine, the lovebirds should have it then?	game/mansion.rpy	983	t "[what]"
mansion1_6b602cff	l	Who?	game/mansion.rpy	984	l "[what]"
mansion1_732002f5	b	You better not mean me and Jenny.	game/mansion.rpy	986	b "[what]"
mansion1_07e7d903	b	Just because you're drunk doesn't mean it's any less callous to matchmake people in the middle of a life-or-death scenario.	game/mansion.rpy	987	b "[what]"
mansion1_1bb01731	t	...	game/mansion.rpy	988	t "[what]"
mansion1_e53840ce	t	You're all such killjoys, I remember why I work long hours now.	game/mansion.rpy	989	t "[what]"
mansion1_00161709	t	At least when I'm on the clock people have to respect my whims and fancies.	game/mansion.rpy	990	t "[what]"
mansion1_29de7ede	t	Fine, if I can't have the master bedroom, I'll take the living room.	game/mansion.rpy	991	t "[what]"
mansion1_d4e01fb0	b	I... okay, fine.	game/mansion.rpy	993	b "[what]"
mansion1_e993bfd2	b	I'll volunteer to sleep down here too, since I organized this meeting.	game/mansion.rpy	994	b "[what]"

mansion1_cef7d461	c	Wait, if Dracula doesn't sleep, then the big bed isn't getting used.	game/mansion.rpy	1111	c "[what]"

mansion1_3963f24f	c	So I was thinking tomorrow evening we could have a dinner party!	game/mansion.rpy	1134	c "[what]"
mansion1_a4fb1fcc	c	It would be a shame to not make good use of all the food in the kitchen.	game/mansion.rpy	1135	c "[what]"
mansion1_a7204ccc	c	Plus I'm sure we could all use a mood lifter.	game/mansion.rpy	1136	c "[what]"
mansion1_a67a4799	c	I can do most of the cooking, but anyone can contribute!	game/mansion.rpy	1137	c "[what]"

mansion1_bf3ab2e3	l	There are still children here.	game/mansion.rpy	1155	l "[what]"
mansion1_804a2621	t	I'm sure Freddy's parents have gotten drunk around him before.	game/mansion.rpy	1156	t "[what]"
mansion1_2345de08	l	That doesn't make it any more okay for you to do it.	game/mansion.rpy	1157	l "[what]"
mansion1_c2c1f850	l	I'm already worried about you and Shahar forcing Bert to deal with your debauchery.	game/mansion.rpy	1158	l "[what]"
mansion1_2cf95677	s	In her defense, the point of the party is to lift our moods, right?	game/mansion.rpy	1162	s "[what]"
mansion1_970685ca	s	A little bit of drinking isn't going to do any damage.	game/mansion.rpy	1163	s "[what]"

mansion1_c1faec7f	d	Before people begin to disperse...	game/mansion.rpy	1175	d "[what]"
mansion1_7e843e32	d	Earlier, we had discussed sharing our crimes and there were some negative reactions.	game/mansion.rpy	1176	d "[what]"
mansion1_c9a57ed1	d	Chances are that even if people did share, they might lie about it.	game/mansion.rpy	1177	d "[what]"
mansion1_3d289165	d	But to build trust and provide us with information, I still think it would be prudent to share.	game/mansion.rpy	1178	d "[what]"
mansion1_1e3c9781	d	Maybe not with the whole group, but in private with someone you trust.	game/mansion.rpy	1179	d "[what]"

mansion1_e3beaeb0	bi	I guess everyone is desperate for someone they can trust in an environment like this.	game/mansion.rpy	1186	bi "[what]"
mansion1_37a4ae20	bi	Even if that person could be the Game Master, even the illusion of trust is very comforting.	game/mansion.rpy	1187	bi "[what]"
mansion1_7908cedc	d	I will not bother trying to enforce this request, since I do not expect everyone to be fully cooperative.	game/mansion.rpy	1188	d "[what]"

mansion1_d419772f	c	Alcohol can kill cats in small doses, and I expect Shahar and Stella might have left an open bottle around.	game/mansion.rpy	1218	c "[what]"
mansion1_6fdf992c	bi	With that dark comment, she went to the kitchen.	game/mansion.rpy	1219	bi "[what]"
mansion1_0e9cc884	bi	Seems like there's still some time before we're going to sleep.	game/mansion.rpy	1223	bi "[what]"

postFT2_ec3ee76c	c	Freddy offered to "take care" of Sesame today, which is great since I don't want his fur or anything getting in the food.	game/mansion.rpy	1631	c "[what]"

postFT2_dd401942	b	Wait, besides alcohol?	game/mansion.rpy	1633	b "[what]"

postFT2_61cf3a5e	bi	I think after Dracula suggested the murderer's been here before, no one would admit to knowing him.	game/mansion.rpy	1657	bi "[what]"

postFT2_398e1aeb	j	...Why?	game/mansion.rpy	1704	j "[what]"
postFT2_29ba628e	b	Boredom, I guess?	game/mansion.rpy	1705	b "[what]"
postFT2_e510374a	b	Anyway, it wasn't too bad.	game/mansion.rpy	1706	b "[what]"
postFT2_d7364c65	b	Once that failed, they let me go to sleep, though I'm pretty tired now from having stayed up.	game/mansion.rpy	1707	b "[what]"
postFT2_df5c8fd2	s	We really shouldn't be enabling their shenanigans.	game/mansion.rpy	1708	s "[what]"
postFT2_e1733eba	b	I wouldn't say we're enabling them as much as tolerating it...	game/mansion.rpy	1709	b "[what]"
postFT2_c791197c	b	Besides, I tried to talk them out of it and they seemed pretty set in their ways.	game/mansion.rpy	1710	b "[what]"

postFT2_8d2c8d6f	bi	Nope, closet is still locked.	game/mansion.rpy	1721	bi "[what]"
postFT2_a22fa80f	bi	Well, I guess I have some time to kill before the party.	game/mansion.rpy	1722	bi "[what]"
postFT2_203b7d3c	bi	Everyone's probably awake by now, maybe I can find someone to talk to?	game/mansion.rpy	1723	bi "[what]"
postFT3_4723fd9c	bi	Well, I still have a tiny amount of time to kill before the party.	game/mansion.rpy	1736	bi "[what]"
postFT3_4e660dfa	l	Hey, Bert, are you busy right now?	game/mansion.rpy	1739	l "[what]"
postFT3_eab11779	b	Uh... I guess not.	game/mansion.rpy	1740	b "[what]"

postFT3_33345736	f	Yeah! Catherine trained Sesame really well!	game/mansion.rpy	1761	f "[what]"
postFT3_24872b20	bi	Turns out, Sesame was trained more like a dog than a cat.	game/mansion.rpy	1762	bi "[what]"
postFT3_470b553d	bi	He could high five Freddy, fetch objects from across the room, even do a backflip.	game/mansion.rpy	1763	bi "[what]"
postFT3_362ec068	f	Sesame and Catherine are really close!	game/mansion.rpy	1764	f "[what]"
postFT3_59efe6fe	f	So he's much easier to train than other cats, she says.	game/mansion.rpy	1765	f "[what]"
postFT3_d58ff2b9	b	That's rather impressive.	game/mansion.rpy	1766	b "[what]"
postFT3_2fd4e724	bi	And convenient for keeping Freddy's mind distracted.	game/mansion.rpy	1768	bi "[what]"
postFT3_495cc79d	b	So uh...	game/mansion.rpy	1769	b "[what]"
postFT3_be35a1a2	bi	I'm still not great at making conversation with the kid...	game/mansion.rpy	1770	bi "[what]"

postFT3_ad5386c9	b	What happened?	game/mansion.rpy	1786	b "[what]"

postFT3_1dbc7c18	b	That... isn't that lonely, Freddy?	game/mansion.rpy	1806	b "[what]"

postFT3_759bc67b	b	Oh uh, just trying to make small talk.	game/mansion.rpy	1822	b "[what]"
postFT3_ee1c2243	bi	...and understand why a kid is in a group of criminals.	game/mansion.rpy	1823	bi "[what]"
postFT3_7e801f75	bi	Maybe it's a mistake?	game/mansion.rpy	1824	bi "[what]"

postFT4_5e1c442c	d	Sorry Bert, nothing personal, but trust and time are limited commodities here.	game/mansion.rpy	2054	d "[what]"
postFT4_be2f54bf	bi	I'd probably just be distracting Catherine and Jenny in the kitchen.	game/mansion.rpy	2058	bi "[what]"
postFT4_3396f181	bi	Well, that only really leaves me two people to talk to.	game/mansion.rpy	2059	bi "[what]"
postFT4_bf85cdab	b	Hey, how's it going?	game/mansion.rpy	2061	b "[what]"
postFT4_c5714c14	l	It's okay. Freddy's pretty torn up about not having Sesame at the party.	game/mansion.rpy	2062	l "[what]"
postFT4_c7c975c4	l	While it's very nice of Catherine and Jenny to cook for us, they were some of the people Freddy got along better with.	game/mansion.rpy	2063	l "[what]"
postFT4_9a8a5f8c	l	So, no offense, but it's pretty much is just me that he gets along with at the party right now.	game/mansion.rpy	2064	l "[what]"
postFT4_cbf16f3b	b	Huh? I thought we were getting along fine...	game/mansion.rpy	2065	b "[what]"
postFT4_75fdef08	l	You asked him about his home life, right? He told me on the way down here.	game/mansion.rpy	2067	l "[what]"
postFT4_323c5e17	b	Oh... yeah, I was just trying to figure out why he's here.	game/mansion.rpy	2068	b "[what]"
postFT4_22fd6aa1	l	I get that you're trying to be helpful but...	game/mansion.rpy	2069	l "[what]"
postFT4_d9497071	l	Given some of the very innocent crimes people are "admitting" to, I don't think knowing more about him will accomplish much.	game/mansion.rpy	2075	l "[what]"
postFT4_dab0fd6c	l	And from I gather his home life wasn't great so maybe it's best not to remind him of that.	game/mansion.rpy	2076	l "[what]"
postFT4_bade334b	b	That's true...	game/mansion.rpy	2077	b "[what]"
postFT4_13f8d8af	l	I don't think you need to do that constantly, we don't need to spend every moment like we did on the train.	game/mansion.rpy	2079	l "[what]"
postFT4_87a68339	b	What do you mean?	game/mansion.rpy	2080	b "[what]"
postFT4_1a880b28	l	It felt like every moment we spent on the train we were fighting for our lives.	game/mansion.rpy	2081	l "[what]"
postFT4_152e2ec1	l	We're still fighting for our lives here, but not as directly, if that makes sense.	game/mansion.rpy	2082	l "[what]"
postFT4_3a5af337	l	I think events like this party are overall helping our morale and make sure there's no more... action.	game/mansion.rpy	2083	l "[what]"
postFT4_ad36806a	b	That's true, but I worry we're giving up, or losing motivation to find a way out of this.	game/mansion.rpy	2084	b "[what]"
postFT4_2ac10e15	l	Maybe it's motivation, maybe it's just that we're somewhere more relaxing.	game/mansion.rpy	2085	l "[what]"
postFT4_ef3d2145	l	I wouldn't overthink it, not like Shahar and Stella are particularly helpful sober anyway.	game/mansion.rpy	2086	l "[what]"
postFT4_b64393d5	b	That is unfortunately true...	game/mansion.rpy	2087	b "[what]"
postFT4_3007f798	l	And people like Sam and Dracula are reclusive, but I still think they're trying their best, in their own way.	game/mansion.rpy	2088	l "[what]"
postFT4_f18db128	l	Anyway, the food is only going to keep Freddy entertained for so long.	game/mansion.rpy	2089	l "[what]"
postFT4_de13bae2	l	I should probably go back to talking to him before Shahar and Stella try to do anything stupid around him.	game/mansion.rpy	2090	l "[what]"
postFT4_5a2f0cab	b	I'll join you.	game/mansion.rpy	2091	b "[what]"
postFT4_09076e88	bi	In part because I forgot to try out the food.	game/mansion.rpy	2092	bi "[what]"
postFT4_89900264	l	Hey Freddy, how's the food?	game/mansion.rpy	2098	l "[what]"
postFT4_27aa82a8	f	It's so good! So many different types of cheese.	game/mansion.rpy	2099	f "[what]"

postFT4_e6fa975f	f	Oh, I get it.	game/mansion.rpy	2104	f "[what]"
postFT4_2a52ae5a	l	Don't eat too much cheese, gotta save some space for the rest of the meal.	game/mansion.rpy	2105	l "[what]"
postFT4_6f53b4f7	bi	As they talked I picked up a plate and took some of the cheese and meat on crackers.	game/mansion.rpy	2106	bi "[what]"
postFT4_ac2f74b9	bi	...	game/mansion.rpy	2107	bi "[what]"

postFT4_7097b932	f	Huh? Looks normal to me.	game/mansion.rpy	2114	f "[what]"
postFT4_9826d689	b	It's so tasty, after all those turkey sandwiches and bar snacks.	game/mansion.rpy	2115	b "[what]"
postFT4_4e5adf54	b	The spices and seasoning on the sausage.	game/mansion.rpy	2116	b "[what]"
postFT4_04de4e85	b	The nibbles of pepper in the jack cheese.	game/mansion.rpy	2117	b "[what]"

mansion2_87ae006b	c	Everyone was congregating in one space...	game/mansion.rpy	2645	c "[what]"
mansion2_bc31e7a5	c	When people left they were all alone.	game/mansion.rpy	2646	c "[what]"

mansion2_2772e2e6	s	Why?	game/mansion.rpy	2690	s "[what]"
mansion2_a8059b93	i	Does that really need explaining?	game/mansion.rpy	2691	i "[what]"
mansion2_815e14b5	s	Fine, we can investigate together.	game/mansion.rpy	2692	s "[what]"
mansion2_32d08638	s	But keep the talking to a minimum.	game/mansion.rpy	2693	s "[what]"

mansion2_ac2f74b9	bi	...	game/mansion.rpy	2703	bi "[what]"
mansion2_efedfa7d	bi	I suddenly started tearing up.	game/mansion.rpy	2705	bi "[what]"
mansion2_58b61534	bi	I... was I holding it in front of the others?	game/mansion.rpy	2706	bi "[what]"
mansion2_dee48544	bi	So we could all seem strong and survive together?	game/mansion.rpy	2707	bi "[what]"
mansion2_2b7bed49	bi	I'd never consider someone like Stella a friend in my normal life but...	game/mansion.rpy	2708	bi "[what]"
mansion2_25ff5e5a	bi	As much as I wanted to sleep back then, we had a good talk.	game/mansion.rpy	2709	bi "[what]"
mansion2_f8ddab4f	bi	Maybe we don't see eye to eye on things, but I got some perspective.	game/mansion.rpy	2710	bi "[what]"
mansion2_aff2aa42	bi	Maybe we're not friends but... we were getting there, in one way or another.	game/mansion.rpy	2711	bi "[what]"
mansion2_1175b783	bi	...This game is cruel.	game/mansion.rpy	2712	bi "[what]"
mansion2_fd0c54aa	bi	I formed connections to not feel alone, only to have them yanked away.	game/mansion.rpy	2713	bi "[what]"
mansion2_e55c879e	bi	And for what?	game/mansion.rpy	2714	bi "[what]"
mansion2_13aa9839	bi	So what if we solve this murder? There will be another murder in a few days...	game/mansion.rpy	2715	bi "[what]"
mansion2_6e260475	bi	None of us have the power to stop that.	game/mansion.rpy	2716	bi "[what]"

mansion2_28f22375	b	No.	game/mansion.rpy	2720	b "[what]"
mansion2_6342b94c	b	No, I can't let those thoughts win.	game/mansion.rpy	2721	b "[what]"
mansion2_9489406c	b	Gotta distract myself from them somehow. The investigation is the perfect excuse.	game/mansion.rpy	2722	b "[what]"
mansion2_26d046b3	b	Have to make it to tomorrow even if I don't know what lies ahead.	game/mansion.rpy	2723	b "[what]"
mansion2_3b7597e1	b	It's go time.	game/mansion.rpy	2724	b "[what]"
mansPreInv_bb7f780e	bi	I should definitely check the bathroom at some point but besides that... I'm not really sure where to go.	game/mansion.rpy	2731	bi "[what]"
mansPreInv_275e55f6	bi	Also, who left the party that could have killed Stella?	game/mansion.rpy	2732	bi "[what]"
mansPreInv_62e3fa8d	bi	Only three people.	game/mansion.rpy	2733	bi "[what]"
mansPreInv_b0b329bb	bi	They're the only ones who left the dining room or kitchen.	game/mansion.rpy	2734	bi "[what]"
mansPreInv_fa8a7670	bi	Jenny, Sam, and Shahar.	game/mansion.rpy	2735	bi "[what]"
mansPreInv_d5043cd2	bi	I have to keep that in mind while investigating.	game/mansion.rpy	2736	bi "[what]"
trial2a_99ac75ad	bi	Everyone gathered in the dining room.	game/mansion.rpy	2741	bi "[what]"
trial2a_4b79dec7	l	Well, this murder should be easier to figure out than the previous one.	game/mansion.rpy	2746	l "[what]"
trial2a_41de6490	c	What makes you say that?	game/mansion.rpy	2752	c "[what]"
trial2a_41c264a6	c	Huh? What should make this murder easier to solve?	game/mansion.rpy	2757	c "[what]"
trial2a_7741ee34	l	Well, there's not a tunnel for this mansion to go through that caused Stella to get stabbed.	game/mansion.rpy	2758	l "[what]"
trial2a_e9432861	l	So someone had to be physically there to do it.	game/mansion.rpy	2759	l "[what]"
trial2a_9bc2aaf3	l	Also, it's pretty obvious what the murder weapon was.	game/mansion.rpy	2760	l "[what]"
trial2a_709a88d0	c	Is it?	game/mansion.rpy	2763	c "[what]"
trial2a_88b3a896	l	Yeah, it was the skewers from the dinner party.	game/mansion.rpy	2764	l "[what]"
trial2a_6b0b99b6	c	Oh no, did the dinner party get Stella killed?	game/mansion.rpy	2765	c "[what]"
trial2a_2ee74fff	b	I wouldn't view it that way, the skewers would have been in the house regardless of us having a party or not.	game/mansion.rpy	2766	b "[what]"
trial2a_7734247f	b	But what makes you so sure it was the skewers?	game/mansion.rpy	2767	b "[what]"
trial2a_ecf7e40e	l	Let me explain...	game/mansion.rpy	2768	l "[what]"
trial2b_381a6054	b	Lauren, I think you missed something because you were watching over Freddy during our investigation.	game/mansion.rpy	2789	b "[what]"
trial2b_2248f8ae	b	When we took a close look at the body, the stab wound was the shape you'd expect from using the kitchen knife.	game/mansion.rpy	2790	b "[what]"
trial2b_c7222ced	b	It'd be pretty hard to create that kind of shape with a skewer.	game/mansion.rpy	2791	b "[what]"
trial2b_c91d6d23	l	Hm... what if they stabbed Stella with the skewer multiple times in a line?	game/mansion.rpy	2792	l "[what]"
trial2b_50e2e894	b	They could have, but I don't think it would produce the same shape.	game/mansion.rpy	2793	b "[what]"
trial2b_8964e89f	b	It'd probably look more like a line of varying width.	game/mansion.rpy	2794	b "[what]"
trial2b_0cd0ca03	b	Also, why would the killer try to do that?	game/mansion.rpy	2795	b "[what]"
trial2b_34b8bda1	l	I guess...	game/mansion.rpy	2796	l "[what]"
trial2b_69106ff7	l	But how did they use the knife then?	game/mansion.rpy	2797	l "[what]"
trial2b_bbf7b6dd	l	I'm still pretty sure it was in the dining room the whole time.	game/mansion.rpy	2798	l "[what]"
trial2b_850ef128	b	...	game/mansion.rpy	2799	b "[what]"
trial2b_2b730ff1	bi	I looked around.	game/mansion.rpy	2800	bi "[what]"
trial2b_4a502b5b	bi	Seems no one had a good answer for that.	game/mansion.rpy	2801	bi "[what]"
trial2b_60e03e5c	bi	Despite our initial hopes, it seemed this case wasn't going to be much easier.	game/mansion.rpy	2802	bi "[what]"
trial2b_8fef0560	i	I have something I wanna talk about.	game/mansion.rpy	2805	i "[what]"
trial2b_63e4bb0f	i	When did the murder actually happen?	game/mansion.rpy	2806	i "[what]"
trial2b_7f05a12b	s	C'mon, Sid, isn't it obvious?	game/mansion.rpy	2812	s "[what]"
trial2b_7ecd61bc	i	Huh?	game/mansion.rpy	2813	i "[what]"
trial2b_0e69ff6c	s	I mean, I don't know {i}exactly{/i} when it happened.	game/mansion.rpy	2814	s "[what]"
trial2b_bdc5004d	s	But we have a pretty good estimate.	game/mansion.rpy	2815	s "[what]"
trial2c_b4532565	bi	When did Stella die?	game/mansion.rpy	2820	bi "[what]" nointeract
trial2c_72db7093	bi	No, Stella was definitely alive at the party.	game/mansion.rpy	2823	bi "[what]"
trial2c_2380abc0	bi	Hmm, Stella left the party only after the second course was served.	game/mansion.rpy	2827	bi "[what]"
trial2c_743cbc36	bi	So I know she didn't die until after that.	game/mansion.rpy	2828	bi "[what]"
trial2c_a6cf2205	bi	That's it!	game/mansion.rpy	2832	bi "[what]"
trial2c_3a3dbe77	bi	No, I have other evidence that shows the body had been dead for a while when we found it.	game/mansion.rpy	2835	bi "[what]"
trial2c_f8e8754b	b	In the middle of the party?	game/mansion.rpy	2838	b "[what]"
trial2c_036bd57a	s	Yeah.	game/mansion.rpy	2839	s "[what]"
trial2c_9a80491a	s	She was around for the start of the party, so obviously she didn't die before that.	game/mansion.rpy	2840	s "[what]"
trial2c_aa8b1983	s	And she definitely died a while ago.	game/mansion.rpy	2841	s "[what]"
trial2c_f31d867a	i	How do you know? You're not a coroner or anything like that.	game/mansion.rpy	2842	i "[what]"
trial2c_1972006c	s	Maybe not, but there's evidence that shows the body's been dead for a bit.	game/mansion.rpy	2843	s "[what]"
trial2c_a786c413	i	I don't believe you!	game/mansion.rpy	2844	i "[what]"
trial2c_0457a728	s	Sigh. Fine, you don't have to believe me.	game/mansion.rpy	2845	s "[what]"
trial2c_68bf6493	s	Bert, I don't think Sid and I will ever see eye to eye. Can you explain it to him?	game/mansion.rpy	2846	s "[what]"
trial2c_2561a03d	b	Uh... let's see, evidence that shows Stella didn't die recently...	game/mansion.rpy	2847	b "[what]"
trial2d_c2649d17	i	The blood dried?	game/mansion.rpy	2857	i "[what]"
trial2d_55b02f2b	b	Yeah, when we looked at the wound some of the blood had dried.	game/mansion.rpy	2858	b "[what]"
trial2d_e519358c	d	Blood normally dries after about an hour or so of exposure.	game/mansion.rpy	2864	d "[what]"
trial2d_99089a80	d	But it varies due to other factors.	game/mansion.rpy	2865	d "[what]"
trial2d_da30dff8	i	How do you know?	game/mansion.rpy	2866	i "[what]"
trial2d_0ae9397d	d	In my... "line of work" I see a lot of human blood.	game/mansion.rpy	2867	d "[what]"
trial2d_11a7a154	b	...Anyway, this suggests Stella died a while ago.	game/mansion.rpy	2868	b "[what]"
trial2d_3a5e1d12	s	It also makes it pretty clear who the killer should be.	game/mansion.rpy	2872	s "[what]"
trial2d_7ecd61bc	i	Huh?	game/mansion.rpy	2873	i "[what]"
trial2d_0f207f38	s	I was thinking about this when Lauren was speaking.	game/mansion.rpy	2874	s "[what]"
trial2d_a4eb8568	s	Our assumption is the knife wasn't used to commit the murder.	game/mansion.rpy	2875	s "[what]"
trial2d_6c9501d6	s	But that's because the knife was in the dining room after the meatloaf was served, where everyone could see it.	game/mansion.rpy	2876	s "[what]"
trial2d_3b4d44d0	s	Before then, the knife was presumably in the kitchen.	game/mansion.rpy	2877	s "[what]"
trial2d_7d51fbf1	s	There is one person who could have taken the knife from the kitchen before the rest of us even saw it.	game/mansion.rpy	2878	s "[what]"
trial2d_d10fe628	i	Didn't you go to get a stepstool during the party?	game/mansion.rpy	2879	i "[what]"
trial2d_d13f2c86	s	Yes, but I only left after the meatloaf had been served, when the knife was in the dining room.	game/mansion.rpy	2880	s "[what]"
trial2d_2f38b600	i	O-oh, that's true.	game/mansion.rpy	2881	i "[what]"
trial2d_f055e88e	bi	In that case, the person Sam is talking about must be...	game/mansion.rpy	2882	bi "[what]"
trial2e_5c66fd76	bi	...is it really Jenny?	game/mansion.rpy	2888	bi "[what]"
trial2e_551cc517	bi	I... I thought we were becoming closer but...	game/mansion.rpy	2889	bi "[what]"
trial2e_3db89447	bi	I guess I hadn't really kept much of an eye on her after we initially explored the mansion together.	game/mansion.rpy	2890	bi "[what]"
trial2e_bbb84368	b	Sam, are you... suggesting Jenny murdered Stella?	game/mansion.rpy	2896	b "[what]"
trial2e_528f7e91	j	Me?	game/mansion.rpy	2902	j "[what]"
trial2e_8eb9711a	s	Is there another Jenny here I could be talking about?	game/mansion.rpy	2903	s "[what]"
trial2e_ec8409f5	j	Why me? I swear I didn't do it.	game/mansion.rpy	2904	j "[what]"
trial2e_192360a5	s	You did leave around when Stella did to "go grab batteries"	game/mansion.rpy	2905	s "[what]"
trial2e_aaf70803	s	And you could've taken the knife with you. Unless Catherine can attest to the knife being in the kitchen the whole time.	game/mansion.rpy	2906	s "[what]"
trial2e_5a8e6016	c	No, I was focusing on prepping dinner.	game/mansion.rpy	2910	c "[what]"
trial2e_45395dca	c	I wasn't paying close attention to specifics like that...	game/mansion.rpy	2916	c "[what]"
trial2e_08e3e7f7	c	So anyone who came to the kitchen when I wasn't using the knife could have taken it out without me noticing.	game/mansion.rpy	2917	c "[what]"
trial2e_0591bdce	c	Did you really do it bestie?	game/mansion.rpy	2918	c "[what]"
trial2e_31a05c7f	j	C-catherine...	game/mansion.rpy	2920	j "[what]"
trial2e_3ae04e18	j	I swear I... I didn't.	game/mansion.rpy	2921	j "[what]"
trial2e_117a3ea1	bi	Jenny was starting to tear up.	game/mansion.rpy	2922	bi "[what]"
trial2e_726778d4	bi	I... don't want to think she could have committed murder.	game/mansion.rpy	2923	bi "[what]"
trial2e_381e252e	bi	Can I believe her?	game/mansion.rpy	2924	bi "[what]"
trial2e_9cad7111	bi	Or would I be letting my emotions get the better of me?	game/mansion.rpy	2925	bi "[what]"
trial2e_f6a58b24	h	Aye, I don't really follow what yer all discussin', but, I got a riddle for ye.	game/mansion.rpy	2930	h "[what]"
trial2e_c36dd7da	s	Riddle? This isn't the time for games, we might as well move to vote Jenny.	game/mansion.rpy	2934	s "[what]"
trial2e_98b083a7	b	Do you mean a question Shahar?	game/mansion.rpy	2935	b "[what]"
trial2e_dd750047	h	That's what I said ye scallywag, a riddle! Don't make me repeat meself.	game/mansion.rpy	2936	h "[what]"
trial2e_bff89b3d	h	I be already plenty exhausted weepin' o'er the death o' me drinkin' matey.	game/mansion.rpy	2937	h "[what]"
trial2e_bb419fbd	bi	...I'm starting to think this pirate speak is just Shahar's way of coping with the situation.	game/mansion.rpy	2938	bi "[what]"
trial2e_1c257b3a	h	Why am I not a suspect?	game/mansion.rpy	2939	h "[what]"
trial2e_63e428a4	h	I went to the kitchen for me rum, and I left the party to grab some tools for me makeshift corkscrew.	game/mansion.rpy	2940	h "[what]"
trial2e_93f40b1e	h	But the scallywag seems focused on the fact that Jenny and Stella left at the same stroke of the sun.	game/mansion.rpy	2941	h "[what]"
trial2e_a59affa4	s	As much as calling me a scallywag makes me wish we had an excuse to pin it on you...	game/mansion.rpy	2942	s "[what]"
trial2e_19a94e42	s	You didn't return to the kitchen after visiting it the first time, correct?	game/mansion.rpy	2943	s "[what]"
trial2e_2d45cf8d	h	Ye, but how's that relevant?	game/mansion.rpy	2944	h "[what]"
trial2e_0fd6c1b5	h	I could still have grabbed the knife and shanked the lady.	game/mansion.rpy	2945	h "[what]"
trial2e_121d57e2	s	Hmm, is that true?	game/mansion.rpy	2946	s "[what]"
trial2f_9b3f0498	bi	No, if the murder happened as Sam described it, the murderer must have returned to the kitchen...	game/mansion.rpy	2951	bi "[what]" nointeract
trial2f_4dbe97ee	bi	Being in the kitchen isn't a much better alibi than being in the dining room.	game/mansion.rpy	2954	bi "[what]"
trial2f_a6cf2205	bi	That's it!	game/mansion.rpy	2958	bi "[what]"
trial2f_741fcbef	bi	If they used the knife, why would they need another weapon?	game/mansion.rpy	2961	bi "[what]"
trial2f_9a7010b0	bi	That would be in character for Shahar or Stella, but not Jenny.	game/mansion.rpy	2965	bi "[what]"
trial2f_71dd876c	b	Sam's suggesting that the murderer had to have returned the knife to the kitchen after stabbing Stella.	game/mansion.rpy	2968	b "[what]"
trial2f_25b3df41	b	Catherine brought the knife from the kitchen to the dining room later.	game/mansion.rpy	2969	b "[what]"
trial2f_deb663e2	b	So, the knife must have been in the kitchen at some point after Stella's murder.	game/mansion.rpy	2970	b "[what]"
trial2f_ab6e6dd3	s	In which case, we're looking for someone who left the dining room towards the foyer, and then was in the kitchen.	game/mansion.rpy	2971	s "[what]"
trial2f_f7e82c17	s	The only person whose movements follow that pattern is Jenny.	game/mansion.rpy	2973	s "[what]"
trial2f_d99469dd	s	So she's the only one that could have reasonably stabbed Stella with a knife.	game/mansion.rpy	2974	s "[what]"
trial2f_2afee3dc	j	N-no...	game/mansion.rpy	2982	j "[what]"
trial2f_e56e4e25	j	Bert... there must be something wrong with Sam's argument.	game/mansion.rpy	2983	j "[what]"
trial2f_e80b4d97	j	Something to save me...	game/mansion.rpy	2984	j "[what]"
trial2f_2bb742e8	bi	I have to admit, Sam does have a point.	game/mansion.rpy	2985	bi "[what]"
trial2f_09acdfe2	bi	If Catherine wasn't paying attention and Jenny hid the knife on her while walking around...	game/mansion.rpy	2986	bi "[what]"
trial2f_b468bb50	bi	It wouldn't be that hard to get away with the murder as Sam had described it.	game/mansion.rpy	2987	bi "[what]"
trial2f_5aa4b5d1	bi	And Jenny would be the only one that could have done it.	game/mansion.rpy	2988	bi "[what]"
trial2f_500810b8	bi	Is this really it? Is the person I thought was my friend a murdere-	game/mansion.rpy	2989	bi "[what]"
trial2f_cb79d4b5	d	Hmm.	game/mansion.rpy	2995	d "[what]"
trial2f_a4299c52	d	Something doesn't make sense.	game/mansion.rpy	2996	d "[what]"
trial2f_8e365066	d	Sam, I'm disappointed, I thought you were more rational than this.	game/mansion.rpy	2997	d "[what]"
trial2f_d2abe179	s	Care to enlighten me then, Mr. Vampire?	game/mansion.rpy	3002	s "[what]"
trial2f_e6d6ad9b	s	I think I'm being perfectly rational.	game/mansion.rpy	3003	s "[what]"
trial2g_bf5b1d7a	b	Sam, we inspected the wound during the investigation.	game/mansion.rpy	3022	b "[what]"
trial2g_0a2cf513	b	It looks like something was used to plug the wound after Stella was stabbed...	game/mansion.rpy	3023	b "[what]"
trial2g_0f01364f	b	What if it was...	game/mansion.rpy	3024	b "[what]"
trial2g_96b0210a	c	Oh, I think I can take it from here, Bert!	game/mansion.rpy	3030	c "[what]"
trial2g_c766549e	bi	...man, I hate being interrupted.	game/mansion.rpy	3031	bi "[what]"
trial2g_699f234a	c	I watched this detective show that was super popular a few years ago.	game/mansion.rpy	3032	c "[what]"
trial2g_dcc03125	c	I think it's called, like... Warlock or something?	game/mansion.rpy	3033	c "[what]"
trial2g_d7349fb7	c	I can't remember the name, maybe because it's copyrighted.	game/mansion.rpy	3034	c "[what]"
trial2g_1043e735	b	Huh?	game/mansion.rpy	3035	b "[what]"
trial2g_7c495559	c	Oh, never mind.	game/mansion.rpy	3036	c "[what]"
trial2g_0fadf58b	c	Anyway, there's an episode where a serial killer builds blades into the belts of his victims, who were royal guards.	game/mansion.rpy	3037	c "[what]"
trial2g_a6a5c3b8	c	Their victims would only die after taking off their belts, so they would die in isolation and it seemed like a ghost killed them.	game/mansion.rpy	3038	c "[what]"
trial2g_5b00cde6	c	Can you guess why?	game/mansion.rpy	3039	c "[what]"
trial2g_e2a285d8	b	...Catherine, maybe it's best if we try to solve the murder in front of us instead of a contrived fictional one.	game/mansion.rpy	3040	b "[what]"
trial2g_028e1f8f	c	Oh, true!	game/mansion.rpy	3043	c "[what]"
trial2g_283fc046	c	Okay so, when someone is stabbed, the bleeding doesn't tend to get bad until the sharp object is removed.	game/mansion.rpy	3044	c "[what]"
trial2g_6b5a071b	c	The idea is that while the sharp object caused the wound, while it's in the body it also clogs the wound.	game/mansion.rpy	3045	c "[what]"
trial2g_996ab863	c	When you take it out, the wound is free to bleed out much faster.	game/mansion.rpy	3046	c "[what]"
trial2g_2fa231eb	c	If your internals weren't critically damaged by the stab wound, the loss of blood tends to be the cause of death.	game/mansion.rpy	3047	c "[what]"
trial2g_0efc72d9	b	You uh... know a lot about this.	game/mansion.rpy	3048	b "[what]"
trial2g_8a8eb3d6	c	I used to be really into this show! I did a lot of searching online after each episode to learn more.	game/mansion.rpy	3053	c "[what]"
trial2g_5c12754a	c	Anyway, something similar probably happened with Stella!	game/mansion.rpy	3056	c "[what]"
trial2g_4b6c15b5	c	Well, we can't be sure whether bleeding or damage to her internals killed her, but...	game/mansion.rpy	3057	c "[what]"
trial2g_056869a7	c	What Bert's suggesting is that whatever caused the stab wound was left in the body and helped limit the bleeding.	game/mansion.rpy	3059	c "[what]"
trial2g_14d70a4b	s	This seems like a stretch.	game/mansion.rpy	3060	s "[what]"
trial2g_bfad1fc1	s	How can we know precisely how much blood there should or shouldn't be based on the knife being taken away?	game/mansion.rpy	3061	s "[what]"
trial2g_0a0a9f3e	s	I feel like we pinned it on Jenny and Bert's just grasping for straws to protect someone he considers a friend.	game/mansion.rpy	3062	s "[what]"
trial2g_017d3edc	d	Sam, I was the one who pointed this out initially, not Bert.	game/mansion.rpy	3066	d "[what]"
trial2g_335a7269	d	...and I guess Catherine explained it in... whimsical terms.	game/mansion.rpy	3067	d "[what]"
trial2g_3c3a719c	c	I'm helping!	game/mansion.rpy	3072	c "[what]"
trial2g_007fc503	d	Vampires understand very well how human bodies bleed, what Catherine described perfectly explains the state of Stella's corpse.	game/mansion.rpy	3074	d "[what]"
trial2g_cc946f35	d	Perhaps I am wrong, and the lack of blood is just due to other factors.	game/mansion.rpy	3075	d "[what]"
trial2g_f4af4aeb	d	But it won't hurt us to consider all possibilities, and it can't help to rush a vote for Jenny.	game/mansion.rpy	3076	d "[what]"
trial2g_4a4bc26f	s	...Fine.	game/mansion.rpy	3077	s "[what]"
trial2g_2e7133a1	s	But you agree your theory is tenuous?	game/mansion.rpy	3078	s "[what]"
trial2g_c8b54e89	d	I suppose, yes. But I think we can do a simple test to see if the kitchen knife could even have been used for the murder.	game/mansion.rpy	3079	d "[what]"
trial2g_fc999049	s	Only now? Why didn't we do this while we were investigating?	game/mansion.rpy	3080	s "[what]"
trial2g_ca19e7a5	d	Well, during the investigation I thought it was obvious the knife wasn't the murder weapon.	game/mansion.rpy	3081	d "[what]"
trial2g_d3035f2b	d	It was only when your theory was proposed that I began to contend with the idea.	game/mansion.rpy	3082	d "[what]"
trial2g_31ad443a	d	Anyway, my proposed test is to try inserting the kitchen knife into Stella's stab wound.	game/mansion.rpy	3083	d "[what]"
trial2g_7b76ffa0	d	How well it fits should be very informative.	game/mansion.rpy	3084	d "[what]"
trial2g_bef35ce8	j	That's... a bit inhumane, don't you think?	game/mansion.rpy	3088	j "[what]"
trial2g_2f5ba35c	j	Shouldn't we be respecting the body?	game/mansion.rpy	3089	j "[what]"
trial2g_e5608154	d	You're not really respecting my body if you think I shouldn't maximize my chances of surviving this game.	game/mansion.rpy	3090	d "[what]"
trial2g_3aa04779	d	Besides, shouldn't you be in favor of this? This could be exonerating evidence for you.	game/mansion.rpy	3091	d "[what]"
trial2g_aacac6c9	j	That is true...	game/mansion.rpy	3092	j "[what]"
trial2g_54fdf5b9	j	But I'm not going with you. I don't want to see that happen to poor Stella.	game/mansion.rpy	3093	j "[what]"
trial2g_889161ab	c	Me neither. That sounds kinda gross to watch.	game/mansion.rpy	3097	c "[what]"
trial2g_2872b8a4	c	Oh, and the stuff about respecting the dead too, I guess.	game/mansion.rpy	3098	c "[what]"
trial2g_f3db4698	b	Don't you watch murder mystery shows a lot?	game/mansion.rpy	3099	b "[what]"
trial2g_a2a41e51	c	Yeah! They're so entertaining.	game/mansion.rpy	3102	c "[what]"
trial2g_850ef128	b	...	game/mansion.rpy	3103	b "[what]"
trial2g_50d715b0	d	Anyways, I don't need anyone to follow me.	game/mansion.rpy	3104	d "[what]"
trial2g_85e000ee	d	I'm happy to do the test on my own.	game/mansion.rpy	3105	d "[what]"
trial2g_ee22b2f3	s	Wait, someone should go with you.	game/mansion.rpy	3109	s "[what]"
trial2g_db1dac8d	s	You could be the murderer and be lying about the results of your "test."	game/mansion.rpy	3110	s "[what]"
trial2g_515762cc	d	Me, the murderer? I never left the dining room.	game/mansion.rpy	3111	d "[what]"
trial2g_463d61cc	s	Fine, if you're not the murderer, maybe you're the Game Master trying to spice things up.	game/mansion.rpy	3112	s "[what]"
trial2g_6d4f4ed0	s	I'm just saying, we should have a second person there to confirm.	game/mansion.rpy	3113	s "[what]"
trial2g_b14d7b51	d	Sure, doesn't matter to me.	game/mansion.rpy	3114	d "[what]"
trial2g_848a03c8	d	Sam, I assume you're volunteering?	game/mansion.rpy	3115	d "[what]"
trial2g_e1554201	s	...	game/mansion.rpy	3116	s "[what]"
trial2g_501cf32c	i	Ha! Not so tough after all, are you?	game/mansion.rpy	3121	i "[what]"
trial2g_426808ea	s	Fine, yeah, I don't want to look at the body again.	game/mansion.rpy	3123	s "[what]"
trial2g_397fb58c	h	I'll go, mateys.	game/mansion.rpy	3127	h "[what]"
trial2g_1828cbc4	b	Shahar?	game/mansion.rpy	3128	b "[what]"
trial2g_87da62b5	h	A stab wound isn't more gross than some of the scurvy ye see on the sea.	game/mansion.rpy	3129	h "[what]"
trial2g_396ff21b	d	Works for me. Let's not dilly-dally further.	game/mansion.rpy	3130	d "[what]"
trial2g_7d648da4	bi	Dracula grabbed the knife and headed upstairs with Shahar.	game/mansion.rpy	3132	bi "[what]"
trial2g_3eccfcdd	bi	The rest of us sat in silence for a few minutes waiting.	game/mansion.rpy	3133	bi "[what]"
trial2g_82b04965	bi	I wasn't sure why.	game/mansion.rpy	3134	bi "[what]"
trial2g_b7fcc4c1	bi	Eventually, Dracula and Shahar returned.	game/mansion.rpy	3135	bi "[what]"
trial2g_68dda87e	b	So? What happened?	game/mansion.rpy	3144	b "[what]"
trial2g_86f60e88	d	The knife didn't fit in the wound perfectly. That is, there was a tiny amount of wiggle room.	game/mansion.rpy	3145	d "[what]"
trial2g_7bcf46a9	d	It's quite curious. Unless the killer intentionally jiggled the knife after making the initial cut,	game/mansion.rpy	3146	d "[what]"
trial2g_45f31e89	d	my guess is the murder weapon is something a bit bigger than the kitchen knife.	game/mansion.rpy	3147	d "[what]"
trial2g_9985224d	d	And I don't see a reason for the killer to jiggle the knife.	game/mansion.rpy	3148	d "[what]"
trial2g_87d0a2b8	s	Aye, I can verify everything the geezer's saying.	game/mansion.rpy	3149	s "[what]"
trial2g_110ff975	s	He did jiggle the cutlass around a bit after shivving the lady.	game/mansion.rpy	3150	s "[what]"
trial2g_f5f7aa23	d	To clarify, I did not "shiv" Stella. I merely reinserted the knife in the existing wound.	game/mansion.rpy	3151	d "[what]"
trial2g_727296ab	d	I will also say, there was little resistance in reinserting the knife.	game/mansion.rpy	3152	d "[what]"
trial2g_31b7cf33	d	I think this is further evidence that the murder weapon was left in the body for an extended period of time.	game/mansion.rpy	3153	d "[what]"
trial2g_e520de15	d	Had it been removed, I might expect the cavity formed by the wound to start healing, creating resistance during my test.	game/mansion.rpy	3154	d "[what]"
trial2g_6dabfc4b	d	But there was a minimal amount.	game/mansion.rpy	3155	d "[what]"
trial2g_cddf13f1	b	Shahar wouldn't be able to verify that, right? Since he didn't put the knife back in.	game/mansion.rpy	3156	b "[what]"
trial2g_294c0b8b	d	No, I'm merely asking you to trust me on this one.	game/mansion.rpy	3157	d "[what]"
trial2g_e7d19694	d	Are there any further questions or objections to my rebuttal of Sam's theory?	game/mansion.rpy	3158	d "[what]"
trial2g_d038cd01	blank	There was some silence.	game/mansion.rpy	3159	blank "[what]"
trial2g_a5d84db7	d	It seems like there is none. In that case, let us proceed?	game/mansion.rpy	3160	d "[what]"
trial2g_c5912af4	j	Proceed how exactly?	game/mansion.rpy	3164	j "[what]"
trial2g_cee087f8	j	While I'm grateful Sam's theory was debunked, we don't exactly have any new ones.	game/mansion.rpy	3165	j "[what]"
trial2g_55d90b6d	i	Um... I have an idea.	game/mansion.rpy	3169	i "[what]"
trial2g_2fdeb197	s	Here we go with another Sid idea...	game/mansion.rpy	3173	s "[what]"
trial2g_09f49bee	i	Hey, screw you, your idea was wrong beforehand.	game/mansion.rpy	3174	i "[what]"
trial2g_e279adfa	b	Sid, ignore Sam. Tell us your idea.	game/mansion.rpy	3175	b "[what]"
trial2g_92a6675a	b	Discussing something is better than discussing nothing, Sam.	game/mansion.rpy	3176	b "[what]"
trial2g_4d488ad7	s	Hmph.	game/mansion.rpy	3177	s "[what]"
trial2g_bcb60ed9	i	Dracula said the stab wound was slightly bigger than the kitchen knife.	game/mansion.rpy	3178	i "[what]"
trial2g_7582fb10	i	So really, we just need to identify an object that's slightly bigger than the kitchen knife, right?	game/mansion.rpy	3179	i "[what]"
trial2g_194207fa	i	There can't be that many of those in the house.	game/mansion.rpy	3180	i "[what]"
trial2g_6ab48b53	bi	Hm... what fits that description?	game/mansion.rpy	3181	bi "[what]"
trial2h_e2dfbb8e	b	...the sheath?	game/mansion.rpy	3194	b "[what]"
trial2h_9e720cd3	s	You know the sheath is a blunt object, right?	game/mansion.rpy	3195	s "[what]"
trial2h_73915bca	s	The whole purpose is to carry a knife around without the sharp part being exposed.	game/mansion.rpy	3196	s "[what]"
trial2h_d6ca1270	s	It'd be pretty silly for a sheath to be sharp enough to cut something.	game/mansion.rpy	3197	s "[what]"
trial2h_9cf4f6d5	i	Well, what else fits the description of being slightly larger than the knife?	game/mansion.rpy	3198	i "[what]"
trial2h_3cfacbbd	i	Since it holds the knife, the sheath obviously is slightly bigger.	game/mansion.rpy	3199	i "[what]"
trial2h_1ea75057	d	Can I propose another experiment?	game/mansion.rpy	3203	d "[what]"
trial2h_7f6bb46a	s	I thought we were in a mansion, not a laboratory.	game/mansion.rpy	3204	s "[what]"
trial2h_7594e3a9	s	What's with all these experiments, anyway?	game/mansion.rpy	3205	s "[what]"
trial2h_d0991431	d	This one is less gruesome and involved.	game/mansion.rpy	3206	d "[what]"
trial2h_63071af9	blank	Dracula took the knife again and grabbed the sheath out of the now-melted ice cream cake.	game/mansion.rpy	3208	blank "[what]"
trial2h_eea5d392	blank	He stuck the knife in the sheath and wiggled it around.	game/mansion.rpy	3209	blank "[what]"
trial2h_649fe990	d	Hmm, there's about the same wiggle room in the sheath as there is in the stab wound.	game/mansion.rpy	3212	d "[what]"
trial2h_28b3400e	s	Yeah, a sheath has to have some breathing room for the knife.	game/mansion.rpy	3213	s "[what]"
trial2h_5c940fe3	s	Otherwise it'd be hard to put the knife in the sheath and pull it out later.	game/mansion.rpy	3214	s "[what]"
trial2h_c3a1ebf4	d	Sure, but my point is that maybe Sid's not too far off.	game/mansion.rpy	3215	d "[what]"
trial2h_feb76d29	c	Oh, I get it!	game/mansion.rpy	3219	c "[what]"
trial2h_dc432975	h	Yes lass, I understand too!	game/mansion.rpy	3222	h "[what]"
trial2h_7bc58c34	l	I think I get it as well!	game/mansion.rpy	3225	l "[what]"
trial2h_fdf6ce6c	s	I think you're all about to speak over each other and spout some crazy theories...	game/mansion.rpy	3228	s "[what]"
trial2h_c01917d6	bi	...are they really all on the same page?	game/mansion.rpy	3229	bi "[what]"
trial2i_1c8bfcbb	b	Wait, everyone quiet down.	game/mansion.rpy	3248	b "[what]"
trial2i_6e388b5e	b	Lauren, say that again?	game/mansion.rpy	3249	b "[what]"
trial2i_4b1be1d4	l	The killer used the sheath as a mold.	game/mansion.rpy	3250	l "[what]"
trial2i_b3c520fa	b	Hmm... it's a bit out there, I'll admit.	game/mansion.rpy	3251	b "[what]"
trial2i_3ffaa5ed	b	But... it would explain why the inside of the sheath and the stab wound are roughly the same size.	game/mansion.rpy	3252	b "[what]"
trial2i_04eafacd	b	Plus, if the sheath was used as a mold for a weapon itself, the weapon could leave the area without the sheath leaving.	game/mansion.rpy	3253	b "[what]"
trial2i_fd2aeab8	b	So unlike Catherine and Stella's theories, Lauren's isn't invalidated by Sam's account of where the sheath was during the party.	game/mansion.rpy	3254	b "[what]"
trial2i_f0eb0624	f	So... Lauren is right? We figured it out!	game/mansion.rpy	3260	f "[what]"
trial2i_fc06a901	bi	I always forget there's a kid here during these discussions of how someone was murdered.	game/mansion.rpy	3262	bi "[what]"
trial2i_ef79f963	l	Freddy, are you okay with talking about this?	game/mansion.rpy	3263	l "[what]"
trial2i_77ba993d	f	Oh, I was napping.	game/mansion.rpy	3264	f "[what]"
trial2i_17bc9d1f	f	I just woke up when I heard your voice.	game/mansion.rpy	3265	f "[what]"
trial2i_209f9553	l	Aww, that's cute Freddy.	game/mansion.rpy	3268	l "[what]"
trial2i_8f8ff3c5	j	Wait, this theory still seems wild to me.	game/mansion.rpy	3275	j "[what]"
trial2i_f83d83cc	l	Jenny, shouldn't you be the one supporting alternate theories?	game/mansion.rpy	3278	l "[what]"
trial2i_a49f6cc0	l	You were just accused earlier...	game/mansion.rpy	3279	l "[what]"
trial2i_256b2fa1	j	Look, I want to survive.	game/mansion.rpy	3280	j "[what]"
trial2i_d061fc91	j	But that doesn't just mean not being accused.	game/mansion.rpy	3281	j "[what]"
trial2i_86a78d75	j	It means finding the truth of what happened, even if I make myself look suspicious in doing so.	game/mansion.rpy	3282	j "[what]"
trial2i_850ef128	b	...	game/mansion.rpy	3283	b "[what]"
trial2i_773dc541	b	That was kind of cool, Jenny.	game/mansion.rpy	3284	b "[what]"
trial2i_e3fc6513	j	Thanks, I thought of it while we were waiting for Dracula.	game/mansion.rpy	3287	j "[what]"
trial2i_4bb048cc	l	Is now really the time...	game/mansion.rpy	3288	l "[what]"
trial2i_184ff648	b	Right, sorry.	game/mansion.rpy	3289	b "[what]"
trial2i_074853ca	b	Jenny, your objection to Lauren's theory?	game/mansion.rpy	3290	b "[what]"
trial2i_dfe66829	j	I feel like we searched the whole mansion pretty thoroughly after finding Stella's corpse.	game/mansion.rpy	3291	j "[what]"
trial2i_df1620b9	j	If the killer used the sheath as a mold, shouldn't we have found a stabby stick that wasn't the knife?	game/mansion.rpy	3292	j "[what]"
trial2i_19a59476	j	Also, what would they even have filled the mold with?	game/mansion.rpy	3293	j "[what]"
trial2i_da0541a4	bi	Hmm... both good questions I don't know if I have a good answer to yet.	game/mansion.rpy	3294	bi "[what]"
trial2i_34893e2c	b	Maybe it would be best if we answered these one at a time, starting with why we couldn't find this object?	game/mansion.rpy	3295	b "[what]"
trial2i_88fcbf74	d	No need. There's a simple solution, really.	game/mansion.rpy	3299	d "[what]"
trial2i_5b921279	b	Hm?	game/mansion.rpy	3300	b "[what]"
trial2i_cfc3b459	d	Yes. One that can answer both of Jenny's questions.	game/mansion.rpy	3301	d "[what]"
trial2i_eb054aba	d	What the mold was filled it, and why we didn't find the makeshift knife during the investigation.	game/mansion.rpy	3302	d "[what]"
trial2i_abda0517	b	...Do you want to tell us?	game/mansion.rpy	3303	b "[what]"
trial2i_73e425fe	d	Bert, I think it's best if someone else fills in the gaps.	game/mansion.rpy	3304	d "[what]"
trial2i_58dd36ab	d	If both of us can arrive at the same theory independently, it's more likely to be correct.	game/mansion.rpy	3305	d "[what]"
trial2i_068b1950	bi	Hmmm...	game/mansion.rpy	3306	bi "[what]"
trial2i_e7f2561a	bi	What explains both the missing weapon and what it was made of?	game/mansion.rpy	3307	bi "[what]"
trial2j_2a529c35	b	Dracula, I assume you're referring to Stella's clothes being damp?	game/mansion.rpy	3318	b "[what]"
trial2j_f1dcecbb	d	Yes. I believe it was water.	game/mansion.rpy	3324	d "[what]"
trial2j_1261dc9f	h	Water? You sure it wasn't a splash of vodka? That'd be more in character fer the lass.	game/mansion.rpy	3330	h "[what]"
trial2j_2b485f2b	d	No, the way the killer formed the weapon wouldn't work with alcohol due to its chemical properties.	game/mansion.rpy	3332	d "[what]"
trial2j_ca6d77a5	d	Not that the liquid itself is particularly relevant to the case. Bert, care to explain?	game/mansion.rpy	3333	d "[what]"
trial2j_de63b06b	b	Is this part of your "arriving at the same conclusion independently" shtick?	game/mansion.rpy	3335	b "[what]"
trial2j_8de6311f	d	You call it a shtick, I call it a deliberate method to maximize our odds of survival.	game/mansion.rpy	3336	d "[what]"
trial2j_75c3e56d	b	Dracula's suggesting the sheath was filled with water.	game/mansion.rpy	3338	b "[what]"
trial2j_75712896	h	Water? How are you gonna stab Stella with a knife made of water?	game/mansion.rpy	3339	h "[what]"
trial2j_bc7e2ae9	h	Water ain't sharp at all.	game/mansion.rpy	3340	h "[what]"
trial2j_d1f991f1	b	Well...	game/mansion.rpy	3341	b "[what]"
trial2k_7697b5c8	bi	I thought this was obvious, but I guess I'll spell it out...	game/mansion.rpy	3346	bi "[what]" nointeract
trial2k_2c5ec178	bi	Wait, we're assuming the sheath never went near Stella's body...	game/mansion.rpy	3349	bi "[what]"
trial2k_a8e66de9	bi	I don't have any idea what that substance would be though...	game/mansion.rpy	3353	bi "[what]"
trial2k_8d6e56a5	bi	Duh, maybe I should have started with that.	game/mansion.rpy	3357	bi "[what]"
trial2k_e2e24660	bi	...am I still drunk from last night?	game/mansion.rpy	3360	bi "[what]"
trial2k_f74da77f	b	Ok, let me rephrase.	game/mansion.rpy	3363	b "[what]"
trial2k_bec6bd39	b	The sheath was filled with {i}ice{/i}.	game/mansion.rpy	3364	b "[what]"
trial2k_602ea0c1	b	That is, the killer filled it with water, then put it in the freezer.	game/mansion.rpy	3365	b "[what]"
trial2k_5e9a7adb	d	Again, not that it matters, but something like vodka has a freezing point below the temperature a household freezer is usually set to.	game/mansion.rpy	3369	d "[what]"
trial2k_f9648719	b	...Thank you for the science lesson.	game/mansion.rpy	3373	b "[what]"
trial2k_7b4dd5ba	c	Ooh, ice is pretty sharp!	game/mansion.rpy	3377	c "[what]"
trial2k_92998fb7	c	I once read a news story about a guy who got speared in the head because he walked under an icicle right as it detached from a roof!	game/mansion.rpy	3378	c "[what]"
trial2k_f8a317a0	b	Um... yes, thanks for the support Catherine.	game/mansion.rpy	3379	b "[what]"
trial2k_9dee24a9	bi	...How does she have all this esoteric knowledge about random deaths?	game/mansion.rpy	3380	bi "[what]"
trial2k_fbed794e	bi	Also, will I get to finish this explanation without being interrupted again?	game/mansion.rpy	3381	bi "[what]"
trial2k_c2a160c3	b	Anyway, the point is, Dracula's theory is that the killer used the sheath to make an ice knife.	game/mansion.rpy	3382	b "[what]"
trial2k_1af11019	b	Since ice melts at room temperature, we weren't able to find the ice knife.	game/mansion.rpy	3383	b "[what]"
trial2k_9b077f38	b	Well, I guess we did find it, but in the form of water that had been absorbed by Stella's clothing.	game/mansion.rpy	3384	b "[what]"
trial2k_733fa9c2	b	This also explains why the wound wasn't that bloody, without the killer needing to come back and remove the knife.	game/mansion.rpy	3385	b "[what]"
trial2k_b81d5393	d	Yes, it is a rather clever and elegant idea, ignoring the fact that it is a murder.	game/mansion.rpy	3386	d "[what]"
trial2k_add0b88d	d	We had been using the murder weapon's location as a means of passing innocense.	game/mansion.rpy	3387	d "[what]"
trial2k_e42f0848	d	But if the murder weapon never had to move after Stella was murdered, all of those alibis need to be reexamined.	game/mansion.rpy	3388	d "[what]"
trial2k_83e39f62	i	This is still kind of a fishy theory, right?	game/mansion.rpy	3397	i "[what]"
trial2k_1bbd57e7	i	We're assuming the existence of an ice knife we never actually saw.	game/mansion.rpy	3398	i "[what]"
trial2k_98af48bc	d	Well, is there another explanation for water on the back of Stella's clothes, right where the stab wound is?	game/mansion.rpy	3399	d "[what]"
trial2k_bfda8a33	i	Maybe the killer tried to wash off the blood?	game/mansion.rpy	3401	i "[what]"
trial2k_86e75089	d	What incentive would they have to do that?	game/mansion.rpy	3402	d "[what]"
trial2k_e836d996	i	...None, I guess.	game/mansion.rpy	3403	i "[what]"
trial2k_4e207ad4	d	As well.	game/mansion.rpy	3404	d "[what]"
trial2k_42b1d37a	d	Unless there are other objections, I think we can move forward with this theory.	game/mansion.rpy	3405	d "[what]"
trial2k_b5faf9bf	d	Especially because it has a clear suspect associated with it.	game/mansion.rpy	3406	d "[what]"
trial2k_d10f60b1	bi	Oh... That is true...	game/mansion.rpy	3409	bi "[what]"
trial2k_003be7c1	bi	This invalidates one person's alibi directly.	game/mansion.rpy	3410	bi "[what]"
trial2k_009eb714	bi	Plus, they would have been able to pull the ice knife murder easier than everyone else here.	game/mansion.rpy	3411	bi "[what]"
trial2k_eff3e802	bi	That person is...	game/mansion.rpy	3412	bi "[what]"
trial2l_ae6c91b1	s	Me?	game/mansion.rpy	3422	s "[what]"
trial2l_175dc0a7	s	Bullshit, you don't have proof.	game/mansion.rpy	3427	s "[what]"
trial2l_3421bc19	b	True, Shahar and Jenny both could have also pulled it off.	game/mansion.rpy	3428	b "[what]"
trial2l_4ff26bf6	b	But think about it, an ice knife would have to be stored in the freezer in the kitchen.	game/mansion.rpy	3429	b "[what]"
trial2l_fb6a106f	b	You also were the one who "found" the sheath in the kitchen later.	game/mansion.rpy	3430	b "[what]"
trial2l_7df825d4	b	Your ice cream cake gave you an excuse to frequently access the freezer.	game/mansion.rpy	3432	b "[what]"
trial2l_24c0531d	b	And you were the one who was adamant about the sheath not being related to the murder.	game/mansion.rpy	3433	b "[what]"
trial2l_76f1b413	s	So what, you're going to declare me the murderer just because you have a few vague ideas pointing to me?	game/mansion.rpy	3435	s "[what]"
trial2l_a0cc753f	s	By that logic you should have agreed about Jenny earlier.	game/mansion.rpy	3436	s "[what]"
trial2l_e7720c66	b	But as far as we know, no one else used the freezer durin-{p=0.5}{nw}.	game/mansion.rpy	3437	b "[what]"
trial2l_2bbfece0	s	No, that's not true.	game/mansion.rpy	3438	s "[what]"
trial2l_0b883693	bi	Oh?	game/mansion.rpy	3439	bi "[what]"
trial2l_3fbad555	bi	Wasn't expecting that.	game/mansion.rpy	3440	bi "[what]"
trial2l_8d19f046	s	Shahar. Care to tell us what drink you got?	game/mansion.rpy	3441	s "[what]"
trial2l_eaae9379	h	Rum on the rocks. What's it matter to ye?	game/mansion.rpy	3447	h "[what]"
trial2l_e48c4359	s	On the rocks. As in you had ice in the drink, right?	game/mansion.rpy	3448	s "[what]"
trial2l_48cd2112	h	Aye, stop asking me such trifling questions.	game/mansion.rpy	3449	h "[what]"
trial2l_72481a14	s	Where'd you get that ice?	game/mansion.rpy	3450	s "[what]"
trial2l_78eb6bf6	h	The freeze-{p=0.5}{nw}	game/mansion.rpy	3451	h "[what]"
trial2l_d64fe02c	h	Ah. Yer blamin' me, are ye ya landlubber.	game/mansion.rpy	3454	h "[what]"
trial2l_731c9a07	s	Not blaming you. Just saying, you also went to the freezer.	game/mansion.rpy	3455	s "[what]"
trial2l_8600686d	s	And when did you go to the freezer?	game/mansion.rpy	3456	s "[what]"
trial2l_0bd867f9	h	After Stella went a-plunderin'.	game/mansion.rpy	3457	h "[what]"
trial2l_0a9ba4eb	s	And Bert, when do you suspect I would have killed Stella?	game/mansion.rpy	3458	s "[what]"
trial2l_8c2ab374	b	When you left to grab the stepstool from the garage.	game/mansion.rpy	3459	b "[what]"
trial2l_5592e362	s	Right, and I was just in the kitchen, but I was in the dining room for a while before that.	game/mansion.rpy	3460	s "[what]"
trial2l_7e42f75f	s	So if the ice knife was used in the murder, I must have grabbed it after Shahar went to the freezer.	game/mansion.rpy	3461	s "[what]"
trial2l_9a7bba14	s	If I got it beforehand, it would have melted while I was waiting around.	game/mansion.rpy	3462	s "[what]"
trial2l_d17d1e7b	s	Shahar, did you see any ice knife in the freezer?	game/mansion.rpy	3463	s "[what]"
trial2l_d3071c16	h	...Nay, can't say I did.	game/mansion.rpy	3464	h "[what]"
trial2l_d8e61c22	h	All I saw in there was an ice cube tray and Sam's pile o' tooth rot.	game/mansion.rpy	3465	h "[what]"
trial2l_c6407671	s	So there you go. If there was an ice knife used, someone else must have done it.	game/mansion.rpy	3466	s "[what]"
trial2l_870e70cd	s	And they must have taken it out before Shahar went to grab a drink, and then they killed Stella shortly after.	game/mansion.rpy	3467	s "[what]"
trial2l_ac2f74b9	bi	...	game/mansion.rpy	3468	bi "[what]"
trial2l_f5d89d1c	bi	Damn, that's a good point.	game/mansion.rpy	3469	bi "[what]"
trial2l_a70e4ac2	bi	I really thought we figured everything out.	game/mansion.rpy	3470	bi "[what]"
trial2l_4ef241ce	bi	We had such a convincing theory, but I guess there wasn't anywhere for Sam to hide the knife.	game/mansion.rpy	3471	bi "[what]"
trial2l_5c51dcd9	h	So what now. Are we lynchin' Sam?	game/mansion.rpy	3472	h "[what]"
trial2l_6c32dac0	s	What? Did you not pay attention?	game/mansion.rpy	3473	s "[what]"
trial2l_6cfac6a9	h	I'm not exactly the brightest matey on the poop deck.	game/mansion.rpy	3474	h "[what]"
trial2l_104feb56	s	Ugh.	game/mansion.rpy	3475	s "[what]"
trial2l_ac2f74b9_1	bi	...	game/mansion.rpy	3476	bi "[what]"
trial2l_b8cfd6f5	bi	Wait.	game/mansion.rpy	3477	bi "[what]"
trial2l_f93e7852	b	Sam.	game/mansion.rpy	3478	b "[what]"
trial2l_ddd60074	s	What now...	game/mansion.rpy	3479	s "[what]"
trial2l_3d31462b	b	Just because Shahar didn't see the knife, doesn't mean you couldn't have hidden it in the freezer.	game/mansion.rpy	3480	b "[what]"
trial2l_a3759ee6	s	Oh? Care to tell us where I hid the knife in a nearly empty freezer?	game/mansion.rpy	3481	s "[what]"
trial2l_15da53b6	bi	Yeah... the knife had to have been hidden...	game/mansion.rpy	3484	bi "[what]"
trial2m_08b4eaaa	bi	The knife was hidden...	game/mansion.rpy	3487	bi "[what]" nointeract
trial2m_ef81cc07	bi	That has to be it.	game/mansion.rpy	3490	bi "[what]"
trial2m_d36ef200	bi	How would a knife fit in a tray with cube-shaped compartments?	game/mansion.rpy	3493	bi "[what]"
trial2m_e08da7d5	bi	No one mentioned anything about that.	game/mansion.rpy	3497	bi "[what]"
trial2m_e9effeab	bi	The ice would melt in the fridge.	game/mansion.rpy	3501	bi "[what]"
trial2m_87054470	b	In the cake.	game/mansion.rpy	3504	b "[what]"
trial2m_2a34444a	b	You could've easily pushed the ice knife into the cake to hide it.	game/mansion.rpy	3505	b "[what]"
trial2m_12b7b4fb	h	Ay lad, wouldn't there have been an obvious hole in the cake?	game/mansion.rpy	3506	h "[what]"
trial2m_b8462fdd	b	Well, when you opened the freezer the hole could have been in the back.	game/mansion.rpy	3507	b "[what]"
trial2m_9e20b080	b	And before the cake was brought out to serve, Sam had already cut a slice.	game/mansion.rpy	3508	b "[what]"
trial2m_32669823	b	The edge of the slice could have been aligned with the hole the knife was hiding in.	game/mansion.rpy	3509	b "[what]"
trial2m_0c7be3b2	b	After the slice was cut, there wouldn't be evidence of a hole in the cake.	game/mansion.rpy	3510	b "[what]"
trial2m_460b2592	s	Hiding a murder weapon in food? That's idiotic.	game/mansion.rpy	3511	s "[what]"
trial2m_cf66be0b	b	Not to mention, the slice was cut rather cleanly, like you had used a real knife.	game/mansion.rpy	3512	b "[what]"
trial2m_241ea408	b	When I tried using the sheath, the cut was much less flat.	game/mansion.rpy	3513	b "[what]"
trial2m_e5db4938	b	I think in your attempt to hide the fact that you hid an object in the cake...	game/mansion.rpy	3514	b "[what]"
trial2m_63fabe10	b	You gave us evidence you had access to a knife of some sort.	game/mansion.rpy	3515	b "[what]"
trial2m_1c0020c3	b	And we all saw the normal knife in the dining room the whole time.	game/mansion.rpy	3516	b "[what]"
trial2m_cede9225	b	So... you must have cut the cake with the ice knife.	game/mansion.rpy	3517	b "[what]"
trial2m_e1554201	s	...	game/mansion.rpy	3518	s "[what]"
trial2m_ba21b40d	s	Fine, just vote for me!	game/mansion.rpy	3525	s "[what]"
trial2m_dc513f26	s	Time to have the Game Master kill me, I guess.	game/mansion.rpy	3526	s "[what]"
trial2m_6dea1b6c	s	Not like any of us have made any progress on figuring out who the Game Master is or how to get out.	game/mansion.rpy	3527	s "[what]"
trial2m_ebcb89d6	s	Might as well just all die swiftly by voting the wrong person.	game/mansion.rpy	3528	s "[what]"
trial2m_b12d66ce	bi	I think in a weird way, this is Sam's way of admitting to stabbing Stella.	game/mansion.rpy	3530	bi "[what]"
trial2m_4b2f042b	bi	There's no more arguments to be had, only anger.	game/mansion.rpy	3531	bi "[what]"
trial2m_ccbe3cd2	i	I knew something was fishy with Sam! You're a jerk {i}and{/i} a murderer!	game/mansion.rpy	3539	i "[what]"
trial2m_82a89418	i	You're really cruel-hearted, you know that?	game/mansion.rpy	3540	i "[what]"
trial2m_158138dc	i	You couldn't just settle for stabbing her! You tortured her for fun, then killed her!	game/mansion.rpy	3541	i "[what]"
trial2m_0fd99d43	bi	...Huh?	game/mansion.rpy	3542	bi "[what]"
trial2m_722ed750	s	What?	game/mansion.rpy	3549	s "[what]"
trial2m_65e84a9f	i	You know exactly what I'm talking about!	game/mansion.rpy	3550	i "[what]"
trial2m_fd6aee62	s	Umm, no, not really?	game/mansion.rpy	3551	s "[what]"
trial2m_f20d0c41	bi	Sam's just as confused as I am...	game/mansion.rpy	3552	bi "[what]"
trial2m_a1e4d4c8	bi	What is Sid talking about?	game/mansion.rpy	3554	bi "[what]"
trial2n_2d7c01b5	b	...The burn wounds.	game/mansion.rpy	3567	b "[what]"
trial2n_06360437	i	Yeah! Sam burned Stella's hands, then killed her!	game/mansion.rpy	3568	i "[what]"
trial2n_1a3b6341	s	Sid, I have no idea what you're talking about.	game/mansion.rpy	3569	s "[what]"
trial2n_36dd4c2b	i	You can't lie your way out of this one!	game/mansion.rpy	3570	i "[what]"
trial2n_89082138	bi	How did none of us bring that back up until now?	game/mansion.rpy	3571	bi "[what]"
trial2n_3e5915d4	b	Wait, Sid, calm down.	game/mansion.rpy	3572	b "[what]"
trial2n_1a28d01b	b	Maybe we can't settle on the killer being Sam just yet.	game/mansion.rpy	3573	b "[what]"
trial2n_7b759f40	s	What Bert, realized your conclusions from before were rather silly?	game/mansion.rpy	3574	s "[what]"
trial2n_5eae5634	b	If you want us to not suspect you, you should cooperate rather than making quips.	game/mansion.rpy	3576	b "[what]"
trial2n_03a38ec5	s	...Hmph.	game/mansion.rpy	3577	s "[what]"
trial2n_eaf6e223	b	The burn wounds. We haven't discussed them at all.	game/mansion.rpy	3578	b "[what]"
trial2n_89571553	b	I need to... think for a moment.	game/mansion.rpy	3579	b "[what]"
trial2n_a2b48513	l	Burn wounds? What burn wounds?	game/mansion.rpy	3588	l "[what]"
trial2n_590dbb23	j	Yeah, I didn't see them either!	game/mansion.rpy	3589	j "[what]"
trial2n_56a465cf	b	Stella's hands had what looked like burn wounds on the palms.	game/mansion.rpy	3593	b "[what]"
trial2n_c1c968a0	b	Her corpse's hands were face down when we found her.	game/mansion.rpy	3594	b "[what]"
trial2n_87820cdb	b	So if you didn't go out of your way to flip her hands over, you wouldn't have seen them.	game/mansion.rpy	3595	b "[what]"
trial2n_6b46928c	j	But is this really relevant to how she died?	game/mansion.rpy	3597	j "[what]"
trial2n_40e9615e	j	For all we know they have nothing to do with the murder.	game/mansion.rpy	3598	j "[what]"
trial2n_05a42a42	i	Yeah! We already know Sam's the murderer! No one else is mean enough to do it!	game/mansion.rpy	3607	i "[what]"
trial2n_5ba9e9ef	bi	Oh boy, we're going to have to get Sid's emotions under control before we can make progress...	game/mansion.rpy	3608	bi "[what]"
trial2n_b19dc863	b	Sid, let's not jump to conclusions.	game/mansion.rpy	3609	b "[what]"
trial2n_ccfb0d20	b	We still need to figure out a lot about these burn wounds.	game/mansion.rpy	3611	b "[what]"
trial2n_59486764	b	For example, how do we know they happened before Stella was stabbed?	game/mansion.rpy	3612	b "[what]"
trial2n_95643b51	b	If someone already was planning to stab Stella, why would they put more effort into hurting her?	game/mansion.rpy	3613	b "[what]"
trial2n_be1d9534	i	I... uh...	game/mansion.rpy	3614	i "[what]"
trial2n_e4658ba0	i	Well, if her hands were burned she couldn't defend herself!	game/mansion.rpy	3615	i "[what]"
trial2n_665feb51	b	That's assuming her hands were burned before she was stabbed, which we don't know.	game/mansion.rpy	3616	b "[what]"
trial2n_58da226f	i	But do you know her hands were burned after she was stabbed?	game/mansion.rpy	3617	i "[what]"
trial2n_877cd697	b	I don't, but someone else should...	game/mansion.rpy	3618	b "[what]"
trial2o_ac2f74b9	bi	...	game/mansion.rpy	3626	bi "[what]"
trial2o_8fe4fbbc	bi	It comes down to this.	game/mansion.rpy	3627	bi "[what]"
trial2o_72209a6e	bi	Are we going to cooperate?	game/mansion.rpy	3628	bi "[what]"
trial2o_28820766	bi	Or will Sam lie and indirectly save someone else in the process...	game/mansion.rpy	3630	bi "[what]"
trial2o_f93e7852	b	Sam.	game/mansion.rpy	3631	b "[what]"
trial2o_71342e73	s	What do you want now?	game/mansion.rpy	3632	s "[what]"
trial2o_97aa6147	b	We need to ask you to cooperate with us fully.	game/mansion.rpy	3633	b "[what]"
trial2o_e011fc79	b	That means owning up to stabbing Stella.	game/mansion.rpy	3634	b "[what]"
trial2o_ba549e42	s	What reason do I have to do that? Even if I did it, I wouldn't admit to it.	game/mansion.rpy	3635	s "[what]"
trial2o_909cd420	b	We have no reason to believe anyone but you was with Stella as she died.	game/mansion.rpy	3636	b "[what]"
trial2o_7c3d4cea	b	So unless you help us identify someone else who could have done it...	game/mansion.rpy	3637	b "[what]"
trial2o_b8404969	b	We're going to have to choose you as the murderer.	game/mansion.rpy	3638	b "[what]"
trial2o_36409e49	b	But if you can tell us what happened honestly, and that includes evidence it wasn't you...	game/mansion.rpy	3639	b "[what]"
trial2o_562f6083	b	It could get you off the hook. And find the real murderer, saving us all.	game/mansion.rpy	3640	b "[what]"
trial2o_05e0f8c2	i	Wait! I don't buy it.	game/mansion.rpy	3646	i "[what]"
trial2o_6da82fbb	bi	What now...	game/mansion.rpy	3647	bi "[what]"
trial2o_72dfc926	i	The Game Master must have chosen Sam to be the murderer, otherwise nothing makes sense.	game/mansion.rpy	3648	i "[what]"
trial2p_a2bfb24c	b	Wait, remember the discussion we had on the first day here?	game/mansion.rpy	3669	b "[what]"
trial2p_2509dcd6	b	We said that the murderer was likely to have been in this mansion before.	game/mansion.rpy	3670	b "[what]"
trial2p_2697eb68	b	We never figured {i}how{/i} the murderer knew they were chosen, because Kaiser died before he could tell us more.	game/mansion.rpy	3671	b "[what]"
trial2p_82581693	b	So it's possible Sam wasn't chosen as the murderer by the Game Master, but has been here before.	game/mansion.rpy	3672	b "[what]"
trial2p_2040548f	b	In which case, it would be easy for someone who had been here before to believe they were the murderer this time.	game/mansion.rpy	3673	b "[what]"
trial2p_c972388a	b	But nothing rules out multiple people having been here before.	game/mansion.rpy	3674	b "[what]"
trial2p_627ebdfe	b	Someone else could have actually been assigned to be the murderer.	game/mansion.rpy	3675	b "[what]"
trial2p_ca081556	b	Also, I guess the Game Master never clarified who we should vote for if the designated murderer isn't actually the murderer.	game/mansion.rpy	3676	b "[what]"
trial2p_732dc1e0	b	So even if Sam was chosen as the murderer, we might still want to vote for someone else.	game/mansion.rpy	3677	b "[what]"
trial2p_adeb862a	i	This all seems so complicated... isn't there that saying about the simplest explanation usually being the best one?	game/mansion.rpy	3678	i "[what]"
trial2p_fb0c95cc	i	Sam killing Stella just makes so much sense.	game/mansion.rpy	3679	i "[what]"
trial2p_51bc2d93	b	It doesn't explain the burns on Stella's hands though.	game/mansion.rpy	3680	b "[what]"
trial2p_7fe9658a	b	Right now, only Sam can help us find a way to explain that.	game/mansion.rpy	3681	b "[what]"
trial2p_94292fc6	i	...Fine, but Sam better do a good job or I'm going to vote Sam off anyway!	game/mansion.rpy	3686	i "[what]"
trial2p_65441b49	bi	Ok, Sid's cooperating now, but will Sam confess and tell us what happened?	game/mansion.rpy	3691	bi "[what]"
trial2p_e1554201	s	...	game/mansion.rpy	3693	s "[what]"
trial2p_97eec1ea	s	Okay, I'll talk.	game/mansion.rpy	3694	s "[what]"
trial2p_a6979213	s	This... this damn game.	game/mansion.rpy	3695	s "[what]"
trial2p_b22b91a9	s	Bert's right, I've been here before.	game/mansion.rpy	3697	s "[what]"
trial2p_bf432918	s	The guy who lived here, Mr. Sydell, he was one of the people I sold drugs to.	game/mansion.rpy	3698	s "[what]"
trial2p_09e050b0	bi	Sam knows Mr. Sydell!	game/mansion.rpy	3699	bi "[what]"
trial2p_6862ae61	s	I... I didn't want to murder Stella.	game/mansion.rpy	3700	s "[what]"
trial2p_ad2f4635	s	But I thought I had to.	game/mansion.rpy	3701	s "[what]"
trial2p_ea100f19	s	We don't know what happens if days go by without a murder.	game/mansion.rpy	3702	s "[what]"
trial2p_8d476ccc	s	Do we starve to death because we run out of food?	game/mansion.rpy	3703	s "[what]"
trial2p_4a3d905f	s	Does the murderer get killed by the chip in their head for not complying?	game/mansion.rpy	3704	s "[what]"
trial2p_e17f748b	s	No offense, but... you're all strangers to me. And now we think you're all criminals.	game/mansion.rpy	3705	s "[what]"
trial2p_247ad646	s	I can't in good faith put your lives above mine.	game/mansion.rpy	3706	s "[what]"
trial2p_027a4362	s	And even if I could...	game/mansion.rpy	3707	s "[what]"
trial2p_b6f5be68	s	What if {i}everyone{/i} gets killed if the murderer doesn't comply and kill someone?	game/mansion.rpy	3708	s "[what]"
trial2p_ac2f74b9	bi	...	game/mansion.rpy	3709	bi "[what]"
trial2p_2af4e0d7	bi	I... I never thought about it from that perspective.	game/mansion.rpy	3711	bi "[what]"
trial2p_f0021a7f	bi	Am I... feeling bad for Sam?	game/mansion.rpy	3712	bi "[what]"
trial2p_d7e62ce4	l	Sam I... think all of understand just how messed up this whole situation is.	game/mansion.rpy	3718	l "[what]"
trial2p_6fabf4ec	l	You or whoever murdered Stella aren't the enemy. The Game Master is the enemy. I think we can agree with that.	game/mansion.rpy	3719	l "[what]"
trial2p_8e1502fe	h	Nay.	game/mansion.rpy	3723	h "[what]"
trial2p_eac54e18	h	Ye blew a defenseless woman down.	game/mansion.rpy	3724	h "[what]"
trial2p_e3e56e94	h	Not to protect yerself from a cutlass, not fer revenge.	game/mansion.rpy	3725	h "[what]"
trial2p_5724b0f4	h	Just a poor defenseless lassie.	game/mansion.rpy	3726	h "[what]"
trial2p_14015505	h	Even if Sam didn't deal the killing blow, I can't fergive a murderer so becalmedly, I'm sorry lads and lassies.	game/mansion.rpy	3727	h "[what]"
trial2p_2686443b	l	Shahar, maybe we can talk this through?	game/mansion.rpy	3728	l "[what]"
trial2p_24fb9ef9	s	No, Shahar's right.	game/mansion.rpy	3732	s "[what]"
trial2p_de53dad4	s	I... hate what I've become.	game/mansion.rpy	3733	s "[what]"
trial2p_4c220dd6	s	I wish it was someone else's turn to murder me instead.	game/mansion.rpy	3734	s "[what]"
trial2p_1458efc7	b	Look, Sam, what happened happened.	game/mansion.rpy	3735	b "[what]"
trial2p_06e5ac63	b	We... I miss Stella, as much as she annoyed me, but we have to look past that now.	game/mansion.rpy	3736	b "[what]"
trial2p_6bc6fc27	b	Our lives are on the line. We can't save Stella now, but we can save the rest of us.	game/mansion.rpy	3737	b "[what]"
trial2p_8d47a5f2	b	But you need to tell us what happened in the bathroom.	game/mansion.rpy	3738	b "[what]"
trial2p_e1554201_1	s	...	game/mansion.rpy	3739	s "[what]"
trial2p_e043d770	s	Okay.	game/mansion.rpy	3740	s "[what]"
trial2p_b374cc04	s	No emotions this time, I guess.	game/mansion.rpy	3741	s "[what]"
trial2p_4f78f4c9	s	I went in there, with the knife made out of ice, just like you figured out...	game/mansion.rpy	3746	s "[what]"
trial2p_ef820239	s	She saw me and greeted me kindly.	game/mansion.rpy	3747	s "[what]"
trial2p_e5a63657	s	I guess she didn't think it was weird I came up there.	game/mansion.rpy	3748	s "[what]"
trial2p_3b50021a	s	But then she then turned back and was messing with the sink.	game/mansion.rpy	3749	s "[what]"
trial2p_9d692d6d	s	I took that opportunity, pulled the ice knife out, and stabbed her in the back as hard as I could.	game/mansion.rpy	3750	s "[what]"
trial2p_cfe692dc	bi	Several people were starting to look away uncomfortably.	game/mansion.rpy	3751	bi "[what]"
trial2p_85c35193	bi	We had asked Sam to do it, we had seen the corpse but...	game/mansion.rpy	3752	bi "[what]"
trial2p_dd94e5ff	bi	...hearing a murder described so casually wasn't easy.	game/mansion.rpy	3753	bi "[what]"
trial2p_ca9e142c	s	She fell hard onto the sink after I stabbed her, trying to brace herself.	game/mansion.rpy	3754	s "[what]"
trial2p_811507aa	s	But she let out a scream when she made contact with it.	game/mansion.rpy	3755	s "[what]"
trial2p_9dcc959c	s	I think because of the pain of collapsing onto it so quickly.	game/mansion.rpy	3756	s "[what]"
trial2p_6b287da6	s	Then her body went limp.	game/mansion.rpy	3757	s "[what]"
trial2p_50f05879	s	I checked her pulse and her heart had stopped.	game/mansion.rpy	3758	s "[what]"
trial2p_e2b531a7	s	I thought I got lucky with where I aimed the knife.	game/mansion.rpy	3759	s "[what]"
trial2p_c9a92c2e	s	And yeah, I left the knife in her body so it would melt.	game/mansion.rpy	3760	s "[what]"
trial2p_7f8993bc	b	Hm...	game/mansion.rpy	3761	b "[what]"
trial2p_263de6cc	bi	Something seems... off about Sam's story.	game/mansion.rpy	3762	bi "[what]"
trial2p_96d000e1	bi	Could one stab wound in the back really kill someone so easily and quickly?	game/mansion.rpy	3763	bi "[what]"
trial2p_cfb1cebb	bi	I guess we can figure that out later.	game/mansion.rpy	3764	bi "[what]"
trial2p_814c15d7	bi	For now...	game/mansion.rpy	3765	bi "[what]"
trial2p_47b0ac1e	b	I think I know precisely what caused the burn wounds.	game/mansion.rpy	3766	b "[what]"
trial2p_366a5775	s	Oh?	game/mansion.rpy	3772	s "[what]"
trial2p_de91de10	b	I had a suspicion even before hearing Sam's story.	game/mansion.rpy	3773	b "[what]"
trial2p_d4e77305	b	But what Sam said makes me even more sure.	game/mansion.rpy	3774	b "[what]"
trial2p_2c369f2e	b	Stella's hands were burned by...	game/mansion.rpy	3775	b "[what]"
trial2q_32ff763f	b	Sam, you said Stella braced herself on the sink, right?	game/mansion.rpy	3786	b "[what]"
trial2q_036bd57a	s	Yeah.	game/mansion.rpy	3787	s "[what]"
trial2q_703d45ae	b	If we look at the shape of the burn wounds, they're very rectangular.	game/mansion.rpy	3788	b "[what]"
trial2q_b3581f9f	b	Just like the sink handles.	game/mansion.rpy	3789	b "[what]"
trial2q_0ccc4fac	b	Before hearing Sam's story, from the shape of the sink handles and the position of Stella's corpse...	game/mansion.rpy	3790	b "[what]"
trial2q_d28a1211	b	We could have guessed the sink handles caused the burns.	game/mansion.rpy	3791	b "[what]"
trial2q_46a1694a	b	But Sam's story makes me even more sure, because Stella apparently braced herself using the sink.	game/mansion.rpy	3792	b "[what]"
trial2q_b1bdb2a1	b	So the short version of events is, Sam stabs Stella, causes her to fall onto the sink.	game/mansion.rpy	3793	b "[what]"
trial2q_de57eb86	b	She grabs the sink handles trying to brace herself, and then the sink handles somehow burn her.	game/mansion.rpy	3794	b "[what]"
trial2q_1566f2fa	b	Sam, if we can figure out what burned her and if it was lethal, that means you didn't murder her.	game/mansion.rpy	3795	b "[what]"
trial2q_e1554201	s	...	game/mansion.rpy	3796	s "[what]"
trial2q_bfd9d79e	bi	Why's Sam so quiet? This is a moment of hope for us...	game/mansion.rpy	3797	bi "[what]"
trial2q_dcbf4b42	s	Thanks for trying Bert, but...	game/mansion.rpy	3798	s "[what]"
trial2q_9bdb8185	s	I don't think the sink handles can be what burned her.	game/mansion.rpy	3799	s "[what]"
trial2q_6c35356a	s	So it seems like I'm not off the hook...	game/mansion.rpy	3800	s "[what]"
trial2q_2a47e844	b	Care to explain?	game/mansion.rpy	3801	b "[what]"
trial2q_156594a4	s	Sure, but we may as well vote me off now...	game/mansion.rpy	3802	s "[what]"
trial2q_014059d9	bi	Sam's giving up.	game/mansion.rpy	3803	bi "[what]"
trial2q_470fc2ce	bi	I need to figure this out, and fast.	game/mansion.rpy	3804	bi "[what]"
trial2r_32a4946c	b	It's admittedly a bit weird, but I don't think the handles were heated until Stella fell onto them.	game/mansion.rpy	3824	b "[what]"
trial2r_2764be00	b	There was a generator upstairs, anad when I looked under the sink I saw some wires fed in through a hole in the wall.	game/mansion.rpy	3825	b "[what]"
trial2r_4a04cc9f	b	It was hard to tell where the wires connected to, but it was probably the sink handles.	game/mansion.rpy	3826	b "[what]"
trial2r_cd678d76	b	And they were probably connected to the generator.	game/mansion.rpy	3827	b "[what]"
trial2r_f0e19f6d	b	With enough electricity running through them, I'm sure they would get hot enough to burn Stella.	game/mansion.rpy	3828	b "[what]"
trial2r_076f3c06	s	That still doesn't explain how they were only heated up when Stella fell onto them.	game/mansion.rpy	3829	s "[what]"
trial2r_cb032ef1	b	I think there's someone who could maybe explain that.	game/mansion.rpy	3830	b "[what]"
trial2r_a374ccc1	bi	But... it's not me.	game/mansion.rpy	3831	bi "[what]"
trial2s_a1531506	b	Dracula.	game/mansion.rpy	3841	b "[what]"
trial2s_7256ab0c	d	Yes?	game/mansion.rpy	3842	d "[what]"
trial2s_589a6fb9	b	What do you know about electricity and the human body?	game/mansion.rpy	3843	b "[what]"
trial2s_6b0dd1d3	d	...What are you insinuating?	game/mansion.rpy	3844	d "[what]"
trial2s_9179cde3	b	I know you probably know enough to explain how Stella got burnt.	game/mansion.rpy	3845	b "[what]"
trial2s_c45a3fa0	b	Since you claim to have conducted "experiments" about this kind of thing.	game/mansion.rpy	3846	b "[what]"
trial2s_96c5fde7	d	And who told you that?	game/mansion.rpy	3847	d "[what]"
trial2s_a0d5ab11	b	Let's just say you should mind your volume level at parties.	game/mansion.rpy	3848	b "[what]"
trial2s_e8cd248f	d	Hmph, so you were eavesdropping then?	game/mansion.rpy	3849	d "[what]"
trial2s_9b6f661b	bi	I wasn't, but I promised Freddy I wouldn't say it was him so...	game/mansion.rpy	3850	bi "[what]"
trial2s_7e0fa319	b	I happened to overhear it.	game/mansion.rpy	3851	b "[what]"
trial2s_7f6a0669	d	A likely story.	game/mansion.rpy	3852	d "[what]"
trial2s_81d903cd	d	Fine, I'll entertain this line of thought. But no one's allowed to inquire further about what Bert mentioned.	game/mansion.rpy	3853	d "[what]"
trial2s_1dca0328	b	So much for everyone being an open book about their crimes, huh?	game/mansion.rpy	3854	b "[what]"
trial2s_1523fe20	d	...	game/mansion.rpy	3855	d "[what]"
trial2s_4f26d955	d	I don't particularly care for you right now Bert.	game/mansion.rpy	3856	d "[what]"
trial2s_7cd9d6fb	d	But for the sake of escaping, I will pretend this conversation didn't happen until we have solved this mystery.	game/mansion.rpy	3857	d "[what]"
trial2s_2d1d660e	b	Care to explain why you didn't speak up earlier?	game/mansion.rpy	3858	b "[what]"
trial2s_cd4fe68f	d	As Jenny said, we all have reasons to avoid bringing up our past.	game/mansion.rpy	3859	d "[what]"
trial2s_151a09e5	d	I was hoping you all would solve this organically, without my help, so I didn't reveal more than I needed to.	game/mansion.rpy	3860	d "[what]"
trial2s_18f3ab08	d	If that did not happen, I would have spoken up.	game/mansion.rpy	3861	d "[what]"
trial2s_e76123a3	bi	I don't believe him.	game/mansion.rpy	3862	bi "[what]"
trial2s_2ecc5bfe	d	Any more questions, or can I finally explain how this may have happened?	game/mansion.rpy	3863	d "[what]"
trial2s_e69e0e22	b	Fine by me.	game/mansion.rpy	3864	b "[what]"
trial2s_db0d0089	d	Alright, no interruptions please.	game/mansion.rpy	3865	d "[what]"
trial2s_79589191	bi	He said that in a way that made it seem like it was directed at the group, but it was definitely at me.	game/mansion.rpy	3866	bi "[what]"
trial2s_02d316aa	d	Electrical current can only travel in closed circuits.	game/mansion.rpy	3867	d "[what]"
trial2s_87fe1fdb	d	For example, if you take a battery and attach a wire to one end only, current won't flow through the wire.	game/mansion.rpy	3868	d "[what]"
trial2s_7fba15f4	d	But when you attach the other end of that wire to the other end of the battery, current flows.	game/mansion.rpy	3869	d "[what]"
trial2s_05905465	d	Think of the sink handles as ends of a battery, since they were connected to the generator.	game/mansion.rpy	3870	d "[what]"
trial2s_a313f1ac	d	And Stella like a wire, with her hands being the two endpoints.	game/mansion.rpy	3871	d "[what]"
trial2s_e280b44b	d	The circuit isn't completed when Stella has one hand on a sink handle, so current won't flow through her from the generator.	game/mansion.rpy	3872	d "[what]"
trial2s_68aac85a	d	But if she grabbed both sink handles to brace herself, she would receive some amount of current.	game/mansion.rpy	3873	d "[what]"
trial2s_1253d28c	i	Um... I have a question.	game/mansion.rpy	3879	i "[what]"
trial2s_7256ab0c_1	d	Yes?	game/mansion.rpy	3880	d "[what]"
trial2s_94be8380	i	I've helped my dad replace car batteries before.	game/mansion.rpy	3881	i "[what]"
trial2s_275dad03	i	He's grabbed both terminals of a car battery before on accident but he wasn't hurt.	game/mansion.rpy	3882	i "[what]"
trial2s_86249629	d	Well, there's two factors at play that determines how bad an electrical shock is.	game/mansion.rpy	3883	d "[what]"
trial2s_5fc2be7a	d	The first is amount of voltage coming from the source of electricity.	game/mansion.rpy	3884	d "[what]"
trial2s_a45d83a3	d	A generator that needs to power a whole house will have a much higher voltage than a car battery.	game/mansion.rpy	3885	d "[what]"
trial2s_d0e41461	d	The second is the resistance of the circuit the electricity is flowing through.	game/mansion.rpy	3886	d "[what]"
trial2s_d02488fa	d	The resistance of a human body can vary a lot.	game/mansion.rpy	3887	d "[what]"
trial2s_8e741590	d	For example, if your hands are dry, there are lots of dead skin cells on your hand that have high resistance.	game/mansion.rpy	3888	d "[what]"
trial2s_af3d62f5	d	This means you transmit less current when you are touching a source of voltage.	game/mansion.rpy	3889	d "[what]"
trial2s_e742a6a1	d	In contrast, if you recently washed your hands, as Stella may have, your body has very low resistance.	game/mansion.rpy	3890	d "[what]"
trial2s_6d10c951	i	Ohhhh. Okay, thanks Dracula!	game/mansion.rpy	3891	i "[what]"
trial2s_e5efc127	h	Gonna be honest, I savvied none of that ye nerd.	game/mansion.rpy	3895	h "[what]"
trial2s_111f09e5	d	Did you just call me a nerd?	game/mansion.rpy	3896	d "[what]"
trial2s_fdc2f5a4	h	And what if I did, ye lily-livered hag?	game/mansion.rpy	3897	h "[what]"
trial2s_1523fe20_1	d	...	game/mansion.rpy	3898	d "[what]"
trial2s_e183c7b9	d	I will overlook that comment.	game/mansion.rpy	3899	d "[what]"
trial2s_88347645	d	The point is...	game/mansion.rpy	3900	d "[what]"
trial2s_424eab75	d	It makes sense Stella could have only been lethally shocked, or even shocked at all, by touching both handles.	game/mansion.rpy	3901	d "[what]"
trial2s_5cb70b58	b	Great, so that answers that.	game/mansion.rpy	3902	b "[what]"
trial2s_5c21d9d7	b	Dracula, there's one more thing that would be good to know...	game/mansion.rpy	3903	b "[what]"
trial2s_1b40ed54	bi	And that is...	game/mansion.rpy	3906	bi "[what]"
trial2t_dc97c0e9	bi	What should I ask Dracula?	game/mansion.rpy	3909	bi "[what]" nointeract
trial2t_7b1c14f0	bi	Unless it was him or Sam, how would he know?	game/mansion.rpy	3912	bi "[what]"
trial2t_0055d4e9	bi	Yeah, that's the crucial piece of information.	game/mansion.rpy	3916	bi "[what]"
trial2t_eead3e4a	bi	Why would he know the motive?	game/mansion.rpy	3919	bi "[what]"
trial2t_3a6fa72d	bi	...did I really just think that?	game/mansion.rpy	3923	bi "[what]"
trial2t_c66dd561	b	We need to know if Stella died from the stab wound or the shock, Dracula.	game/mansion.rpy	3926	b "[what]"
trial2t_2cc8c5ab	b	Otherwise, even if we learn who set up the wiring, we can't identify the murderer.	game/mansion.rpy	3927	b "[what]"
trial2t_974fbcbd	d	Hmm, I can't answer for sure.	game/mansion.rpy	3928	d "[what]"
trial2t_6b2410d1	d	But it was pretty likely the shock.	game/mansion.rpy	3929	d "[what]"
trial2t_08049280	d	From what I saw, a stab wound in the back like that wouldn't have killed Stella immediately.	game/mansion.rpy	3930	d "[what]"
trial2t_3ac23211	d	Even if Sam stabbed a vital organ, Stella would remain conscious for probably at least 15 seconds.	game/mansion.rpy	3931	d "[what]"
trial2t_ec974e16	d	In contrast, electrocution can kill someone nearly instantly.	game/mansion.rpy	3932	d "[what]"
trial2t_35fa97e8	d	The fact that Stella was both stabbed and shocked, and didn't get up once stabbed...	game/mansion.rpy	3933	d "[what]"
trial2t_ee9fbbab	d	...suggests the shock killed her before she could act while conscious.	game/mansion.rpy	3934	d "[what]"
trial2t_58e43e43	j	I have a question.	game/mansion.rpy	3938	j "[what]"
trial2t_6640e16e	j	How do we know Dracula and Sam aren't conspiring?	game/mansion.rpy	3944	j "[what]"
trial2t_9b2162ba	j	They spent a lot of time since we got to the mansion talking to each other in private.	game/mansion.rpy	3945	j "[what]"
trial2t_1782a35b	d	Hmph, and what would I have to gain from protecting Sam if I didn't believe there was another murderer?	game/mansion.rpy	3946	d "[what]"
trial2t_18f6354f	j	I dunno. Maybe you're the Game Master and you know you won't die regardless.	game/mansion.rpy	3947	j "[what]"
trial2t_93856655	d	I assure you I am not.	game/mansion.rpy	3948	d "[what]"
trial2t_ee708230	d	But if I was and wanted to kill you all, why wouldn't I just do it myself instead of through this game?	game/mansion.rpy	3949	d "[what]"
trial2t_12c03728	j	Maybe the Game Master is working for someone and has to follow their rules?	game/mansion.rpy	3950	j "[what]"
trial2t_f4d4ecdc	d	That seems silly, they aren't the Master then, just a Game Servant.	game/mansion.rpy	3951	d "[what]"
trial2t_65fede8c	d	If I must tell you, I was trying to persuade Sam to work with me to get out of here.	game/mansion.rpy	3952	d "[what]"
trial2t_f0ed6562	d	But Sam claimed not to trust me since I claimed to be a vampire, so I was mostly trying to prove I was one.	game/mansion.rpy	3953	d "[what]"
trial2t_b0daff6c	s	Yeah, I didn't want to work with him because I thought if I did he would find out I was the murderer.	game/mansion.rpy	3957	s "[what]"
trial2t_fcc0fa33	s	And talking to him "in private" gave me an excuse to not talk to others who might find out.	game/mansion.rpy	3958	s "[what]"
trial2t_2ef70029	s	Plus he talks a lot, so it gave me time to think.	game/mansion.rpy	3959	s "[what]"
trial2t_dda22872	b	Regardless, I think it's unlikely Dracula and Sam are conspiring for now.	game/mansion.rpy	3960	b "[what]"
trial2t_299c35bb	b	If the Game Master is playing such an active role in setting up a lie...	game/mansion.rpy	3961	b "[what]"
trial2t_dc5611d9	b	I don't think there's any way we solve this case anyway.	game/mansion.rpy	3962	b "[what]"
trial2t_ae3a930f	b	Plus, we can't really rely on anyone besides Dracula to explain the state of the body.	game/mansion.rpy	3963	b "[what]"
trial2t_a693392c	b	So we have to take the chance and trust him.	game/mansion.rpy	3964	b "[what]"
trial2t_b4fa3fc0	j	...	game/mansion.rpy	3965	j "[what]"
trial2t_0e499528	j	Okay, I trust you Bert.	game/mansion.rpy	3966	j "[what]"
trial2t_7e2b8f28	j	So if you trust him, I trust him.	game/mansion.rpy	3967	j "[what]"
trial2t_40f0afe1	bi	Jenny trusts me.	game/mansion.rpy	3968	bi "[what]"
trial2t_3e15074b	bi	I can't let her down.	game/mansion.rpy	3969	bi "[what]"
trial2t_b7ea7b14	b	Okay, for now our main priority is to figure out who set up the wiring.	game/mansion.rpy	3970	b "[what]"
trial2t_f13f272b	l	Well that's straightforward, right?	game/mansion.rpy	3974	l "[what]"
trial2t_575e5e2c	l	It's probably Jenny.	game/mansion.rpy	3975	l "[what]"
trial2t_1043e735	b	Huh?	game/mansion.rpy	3976	b "[what]"
trial2t_fb76a5e7	j	Huh? Me again?...	game/mansion.rpy	3977	j "[what]"
trial2t_abbd1034	l	We found the generator in Jenny's room.	game/mansion.rpy	3978	l "[what]"
trial2t_7705a22d	l	That room also shares a wall with the bathroom, and that wall is the wall where the sink is.	game/mansion.rpy	3979	l "[what]"
trial2t_8d2ab7cd	l	So it'd be easiest for her to set it up.	game/mansion.rpy	3980	l "[what]"
trial2t_d09b3335	b	No, I'm pretty sure the generator got moved there later, we can't blame Jenny based on that.	game/mansion.rpy	3981	b "[what]"
trial2t_73ff3589	b	There's something missing from that room that the murderer would have needed...	game/mansion.rpy	3982	b "[what]"
trial2u_bcfc49a0	b	If the generator was in that room when Stella died...	game/mansion.rpy	3993	b "[what]"
trial2u_2d734e58	b	The wires would have needed to go from the generator to the bathroom.	game/mansion.rpy	3994	b "[what]"
trial2u_fccba5fb	l	Well yeah, but the murderer could have just removed the wires later.	game/mansion.rpy	3995	l "[what]"
trial2u_539786ee	b	No, it's not just that.	game/mansion.rpy	3996	b "[what]"
trial2u_0a80a2cb	b	When I looked under the sink and saw the wires, they fed into the bathroom through a hole in the wall.	game/mansion.rpy	3997	b "[what]"
trial2u_e74cfdba	b	But if you look at the wall of Jenny's bedroom...	game/mansion.rpy	3998	b "[what]"
trial2u_55aeaebd	b	There's no holes in the wall. So there's no way to feed the wires into the bathroom from there.	game/mansion.rpy	3999	b "[what]"
trial2u_532c929f	l	Hm... that makes sense. Sorry Jenny, looks like I fell for the bait of someone framing you.	game/mansion.rpy	4000	l "[what]"
trial2u_a78b08bd	j	It's... okay. I guess I'm used to it now.	game/mansion.rpy	4001	j "[what]"
trial2u_f52b45d6	bi	She didn't sound very okay, but that was a topic for later.	game/mansion.rpy	4002	bi "[what]"
trial2u_b7293ada	l	I'm confused though. If the generator wasn't in Jenny's room, where was it?	game/mansion.rpy	4003	l "[what]"
trial2u_7e7a6586	b	Well, when you consider that the sink is on the left wall when you enter the bathroom, we can figure that out easily.	game/mansion.rpy	4004	b "[what]"
trial2v_a455ef85	b	The generator was in the closet.	game/mansion.rpy	4015	b "[what]"
trial2v_0133921e	l	The one in the second floor hallway?	game/mansion.rpy	4016	l "[what]"
trial2v_d9ae6dd2	b	Yeah, that's the only other room that shares that wall with the bathroom.	game/mansion.rpy	4017	b "[what]"
trial2v_6e03dd39	j	Wait, isn't that closet locked?	game/mansion.rpy	4018	j "[what]"
trial2v_e90bdab2	j	How could the killer have gotten in?	game/mansion.rpy	4019	j "[what]"
trial2v_2f60d889	b	I'm not sure. Maybe they found the key before the rest of us and didn't tell anyone.	game/mansion.rpy	4020	b "[what]"
trial2v_735a2291	b	Maybe they were the first to try opening the closet and locked it from the inside.	game/mansion.rpy	4021	b "[what]"
trial2v_4dd41810	b	But that's the only place that could have a hole in the wall matching the bathroom's.	game/mansion.rpy	4022	b "[what]"
trial2v_35deaf11	b	We've seen every other room and found no holes, so by process of elimination that must be it.	game/mansion.rpy	4023	b "[what]"
trial2v_728454df	j	Hm... yeah, I can't think of any other solution for where it could have been.	game/mansion.rpy	4024	j "[what]"
trial2v_434c8c27	j	But I don't see how it's useful to know the generator was in the closet...	game/mansion.rpy	4032	j "[what]"
trial2v_188f3e59	j	It's not like anyone's admitted to having access to the closet.	game/mansion.rpy	4033	j "[what]"
trial2w_f57aa2ef	bi	That's true, but the generator being in the closet still could help us identify the murderer, since...	game/mansion.rpy	4038	bi "[what]" nointeract
trial2w_75ac9129	b	Yeah...	game/mansion.rpy	4041	b "[what]"
trial2w_28a75f31	bi	This is true, but we didn't need to know the generator was in the closet to figure that out.	game/mansion.rpy	4044	bi "[what]"
trial2w_e7d3d188	bi	Hmm, that doesn't really rule anyone out besides Freddy.	game/mansion.rpy	4048	bi "[what]"
trial2w_56196334	bi	Also, that would've been true even if the generator killed Stella from Jenny's room.	game/mansion.rpy	4049	bi "[what]"
trial2w_70912618	bi	That's something we knew before we decided the generator was in the closet.	game/mansion.rpy	4053	bi "[what]"
trial2w_d50b77f0	b	If the generator ended up in a bedroom but it was in the closet when Stella died...	game/mansion.rpy	4056	b "[what]"
trial2w_8a880a07	b	It must have been moved after Stella died.	game/mansion.rpy	4057	b "[what]"
trial2w_457370c2	b	So we just need to figure out who moved it between Stella's death and us finding the body.	game/mansion.rpy	4058	b "[what]"
trial2w_272caf54	i	Aha!	game/mansion.rpy	4066	i "[what]"
trial2w_de48d3aa	i	It was Sam all along!	game/mansion.rpy	4067	i "[what]"
trial2w_5d1c5b01	i	Sam would be the only person who could move the generator.	game/mansion.rpy	4068	i "[what]"
trial2w_db0cb88b	s	No, I swear it wasn't me.	game/mansion.rpy	4076	s "[what]"
trial2w_4bf52773	s	I knew nothing about the generator before a few minutes ago...	game/mansion.rpy	4077	s "[what]"
trial2w_04b65da5	i	Liar! The murderer would say that too!	game/mansion.rpy	4083	i "[what]"
trial2w_b7b3d31e	bi	Yet again, I'm going to have to calm Sid down...	game/mansion.rpy	4084	bi "[what]"
trial2x_b5509b71	b	No, actually, not everything makes sense if Sam could move the generator easily.	game/mansion.rpy	4104	b "[what]"
trial2x_61905bc9	i	Huh? Are you saying Sam is a weakling?	game/mansion.rpy	4105	i "[what]"
trial2x_578a9022	i	Sam might have weak morals but morals aren't what lift objects.	game/mansion.rpy	4106	i "[what]"
trial2x_1a6babac	b	No, it's not that, it's the rope we found tied to the generator.	game/mansion.rpy	4107	b "[what]"
trial2x_29f3094e	b	Why would that be there if the murderer could have easily moved it around?	game/mansion.rpy	4108	b "[what]"
trial2x_8e0620f5	b	The generator even has wheels, as long as you can reach the handle you can drag it around upstairs.	game/mansion.rpy	4109	b "[what]"
trial2x_bd216daf	i	So do you think it was someone who couldn't have easily moved it around?	game/mansion.rpy	4110	i "[what]"
trial2x_85a5d288	i	That means it must be Freddy!	game/mansion.rpy	4111	i "[what]"
trial2x_59aeadb9	f	M-me? But I'm just a frog...	game/mansion.rpy	4117	f "[what]"
trial2x_6ab10c06	l	Hey, leave Freddy out of this.	game/mansion.rpy	4120	l "[what]"
trial2x_66753a69	i	I-I'm just saying...	game/mansion.rpy	4121	i "[what]"
trial2x_32958af9	b	No, I don't think it's Freddy.	game/mansion.rpy	4122	b "[what]"
trial2x_5f3e66f7	b	Because the murderer had to lift the generator up the stairs.	game/mansion.rpy	4123	b "[what]"
trial2x_9f6a18c9	b	No offense Freddy, but I don't think you could've done that.	game/mansion.rpy	4124	b "[what]"
trial2x_f28d0d99	l	Hey, are you saying I helped him?	game/mansion.rpy	4125	l "[what]"
trial2x_dfd1f691	b	What? No, where'd you get that idea?	game/mansion.rpy	4126	b "[what]"
trial2x_c21c8dd3	i	I... I don't get it Bert.	game/mansion.rpy	4127	i "[what]"
trial2x_ca159c8f	i	Earlier you said the murderer couldn't move the generator from the closet to the bedroom without the rope.	game/mansion.rpy	4128	i "[what]"
trial2x_648a59d0	i	But now you're saying the murderer was able to move it up the stairs.	game/mansion.rpy	4129	i "[what]"
trial2x_95a4e6ea	i	How can both be true? That just seems like a contradiction.	game/mansion.rpy	4130	i "[what]"
trial2x_ddf0c0e0	b	Hm, it's true they were able to move it up the stairs, but only before the murder actually happened.	game/mansion.rpy	4131	b "[what]"
trial2x_792c5efd	i	What, did they suddenly get weaker once the murder happened?	game/mansion.rpy	4132	i "[what]"
trial2x_6df68296	b	No, I think just the circumstances of when Stella died are the key here.	game/mansion.rpy	4133	b "[what]"
trial2x_d4a6c56f	b	Remember, we know the generator moved after Stella died.	game/mansion.rpy	4134	b "[what]"
trial2x_08cfb22f	b	And we don't think it's Sam because Sam wouldn't need a rope to move the generator.	game/mansion.rpy	4135	b "[what]"
trial2x_93568871	b	With that in mind, it can only be...	game/mansion.rpy	4136	b "[what]"
trial2y_1f5067dd	c	Me? C'mon Bert, don't be silly.	game/mansion.rpy	4151	c "[what]"
trial2y_7bb372b9	c	I was in the kitchen or dining room for the whole party, how could I move the generator?	game/mansion.rpy	4152	c "[what]"
trial2y_5a43258d	c	Stella's dead, now's not the time for jokes!	game/mansion.rpy	4153	c "[what]"
trial2y_db357e59	b	I'm not joking. Maybe you couldn't have directly moved the generator after Stella died...	game/mansion.rpy	4155	b "[what]"
trial2y_5acee473	b	But Sesame could have.	game/mansion.rpy	4156	b "[what]"
trial2y_d19f855d	c	...	game/mansion.rpy	4157	c "[what]"
trial2y_fc4bfb51	b	It adds up. Sesame was upstairs along with Sam when the murder happened.	game/mansion.rpy	4158	b "[what]"
trial2y_28d6ea7c	b	After Sam left, Sesame was the only one up there.	game/mansion.rpy	4159	b "[what]"
trial2y_bba84e5e	b	You would have been able to move the generator upstairs, but you needed Sesame to move it for you during the party.	game/mansion.rpy	4160	b "[what]"
trial2y_132fdbfc	b	Sesame couldn't move the generator without some assistance since, well, he's a cat.	game/mansion.rpy	4161	b "[what]"
trial2y_3e385eab	b	But the rope would give Sesame something to pull the generator with.	game/mansion.rpy	4162	b "[what]"
trial2y_8f5f8a4a	b	For most cats and their owners this wouldn't be possible, but as Freddy knows, Sesame is a very talented and well-trained cat.	game/mansion.rpy	4163	b "[what]"
trial2y_8320dd47	bi	Freddy quickly nodded and then started tying his shoes.	game/mansion.rpy	4168	bi "[what]"
trial2y_ec8912d8	b	I saw him fetch objects for Freddy, he could've easily "fetched" the generator to the bedroom.	game/mansion.rpy	4170	b "[what]"
trial2y_b6642854	c	Fufufu.	game/mansion.rpy	4171	c "[what]"
trial2y_1043e735	b	Huh?	game/mansion.rpy	4172	b "[what]"
trial2y_fb82a5a9	c	That's a funny theory Bert. You should try writing a mystery novel if you get out of here!	game/mansion.rpy	4174	c "[what]"
trial2y_a57d41ae	c	But you still haven't explained one thing.	game/mansion.rpy	4175	c "[what]"
trial2y_cff5ca44	c	Where could I have gotten the wires from?	game/mansion.rpy	4176	c "[what]"
trial2y_e00a988f	c	How do you know someone didn't put the wires there later to make it look like the generator killed her?	game/mansion.rpy	4177	c "[what]"
trial2y_afef2184	c	Without knowing that, I'd still believe it's Sam's stab wound that killed her.	game/mansion.rpy	4178	c "[what]"
trial2y_fd44ff0b	bi	Why didn't she bring this up earlier?	game/mansion.rpy	4179	bi "[what]"
trial2y_f92e57ce	bi	No, I know why. She's on the defensive. She's grasping for straws to find a way out.	game/mansion.rpy	4180	bi "[what]"
trial2y_3f3cc1e9	bi	Luckily, the answer is pretty obvious.	game/mansion.rpy	4181	bi "[what]"
trial2y_f297d1ad	b	The wires... you got them from...	game/mansion.rpy	4182	b "[what]"
trial2z_fb1ff6fd	b	You got them from the kitchen.	game/mansion.rpy	4189	b "[what]"
trial2z_19440ebc	b	During the party, the microwave and oven clocks weren't working suddenly, but you guys were still able to cook...	game/mansion.rpy	4190	b "[what]"
trial2z_8f4ba3ca	b	I thought it was strange at the time, but it makes sense if you know the murderer needed to get wires from somewhere.	game/mansion.rpy	4191	b "[what]"
trial2z_b71655f1	b	Why not steal them from appliances lying around the house?	game/mansion.rpy	4192	b "[what]"
trial2z_c2cb8d0a	b	It also gave the murderer a reason to send Jenny out of the party, setting her up as a potential culprit.	game/mansion.rpy	4193	b "[what]"
trial2z_65d6e2b4	b	And you, Catherine, spent the last few hours yesterday in the kitchen, and got up early today and went to the kitchen.	game/mansion.rpy	4194	b "[what]"
trial2z_6510968f	b	If anyone would have had an easy time stealing those wires, it would be you.	game/mansion.rpy	4195	b "[what]"
trial2z_d19f855d	c	...	game/mansion.rpy	4196	c "[what]"
trial2z_b537cc15	c	That makes sense, but anyone could've woken up in the middle of the night and stole the wires!	game/mansion.rpy	4197	c "[what]"
trial2z_189a929c	i	No! You mean lady!	game/mansion.rpy	4203	i "[what]"
trial2z_4a57ab70	i	You... you killed Stella, and then made me yell at Sam.	game/mansion.rpy	4204	i "[what]"
trial2z_019b479a	i	I'll never forgive you. I'm going to prove you did it!	game/mansion.rpy	4205	i "[what]"
trial2z_63f7c703	bi	Will he? Hm, it's nice to have someone else do the work for once.	game/mansion.rpy	4206	bi "[what]"
trial2z_431b4d15	i	Let's go check the rope! If Sesame used it, there must be bite marks or something on the end!	game/mansion.rpy	4207	i "[what]"
trial2z_ab981233	c	Wh... wha?	game/mansion.rpy	4208	c "[what]"
trial2z_d136aa65	b	Hm, that's actually a really good idea Sid.	game/mansion.rpy	4209	b "[what]"
trial2z_c2f7a28f	c	Bu-but, Sesame used it as a scratching toy!	game/mansion.rpy	4210	c "[what]"
trial2z_51757f31	c	Of course there's gonna be marks on it.	game/mansion.rpy	4211	c "[what]"
trial2z_b22f20f4	c	C'mon guys, I'm Catherine, I'm always so jolly and perky, how could I kill Stella?	game/mansion.rpy	4212	c "[what]"
trial2z_bf93b227	i	There could be scratch marks sure...	game/mansion.rpy	4213	i "[what]"
trial2z_bd4d8ef3	i	But bite marks would look different!	game/mansion.rpy	4214	i "[what]"
trial2z_b6b373a9	b	That's true. They'd be single points and probably come in pairs.	game/mansion.rpy	4215	b "[what]"
trial2z_c32d4c82	b	Scratch marks would come in triplets and be longer lines.	game/mansion.rpy	4216	b "[what]"
trial2z_d19f855d_1	c	...	game/mansion.rpy	4217	c "[what]"
trial2z_4e188601	b	And I bet if Sesame needed a chew toy to bite on, you would've said he used it as a chew toy, not a scratching toy.	game/mansion.rpy	4218	b "[what]"
trial2z_0a39d8e5	b	But you didn't, you've only ever said he could use it as a scratching toy.	game/mansion.rpy	4219	b "[what]"
trial2z_0aee1330	b	Which makes sense, he's a cat, not a dog. That's probably more his thing.	game/mansion.rpy	4220	b "[what]"
trial2z_d19f855d_2	c	...	game/mansion.rpy	4221	c "[what]"
trial2z_69bd6634	c	Yeah, you got me.	game/mansion.rpy	4227	c "[what]"
trial2z_1043e735	b	Huh?	game/mansion.rpy	4228	b "[what]"
trial2z_c658e8f6	c	I... I lost. I won't draw it out anymore.	game/mansion.rpy	4229	c "[what]"
trial2z_51d07ffb	c	Good job guys! You did great, I didn't think anyone would come close to figuring it out.	game/mansion.rpy	4236	c "[what]"
trial2z_bc2f9153	c	I guess I shouldn't have tried to make it look like Jenny did it, otherwise you would've never known it was me.	game/mansion.rpy	4237	c "[what]"
trial2z_081e2b0a	c	Silly me as usual!	game/mansion.rpy	4238	c "[what]"
trial2z_de5a9cbd	c	Should've spent more time thinking about that and less time thinking about recipes.	game/mansion.rpy	4240	c "[what]"
trial2z_6e35510a	b	You're admitting it? You really killed Stella?	game/mansion.rpy	4241	b "[what]"
trial2z_aebd631f	c	Mhm, you heard me right.	game/mansion.rpy	4242	c "[what]"
trial2z_cab67f50	c	Oh well, I guess I had this coming. All those houses I burgled, I almost got caught a few times.	game/mansion.rpy	4243	c "[what]"
trial2z_a0b7fc70	b	Burgled?	game/mansion.rpy	4244	b "[what]"
trial2z_a37e0332	c	Oh, yeah, I forgot you guys didn't know the truth.	game/mansion.rpy	4250	c "[what]"
trial2z_2a44cee6	c	I robbed to make a living. A cat burglar, if you will, teehee.	game/mansion.rpy	4251	c "[what]"
trial2z_05ab2a93	c	C'mon, you really think working in a shelter pays a girl enough to live?	game/mansion.rpy	4253	c "[what]"
trial2z_6ae230d7	c	They barely feed the cats enough to live as is!	game/mansion.rpy	4254	c "[what]"
trial2z_12835589	h	Ye wench! Ye've slain my second mate!	game/mansion.rpy	4261	h "[what]"
trial2z_efa5aa54	c	Yeah... sorry Shahar. Not much I could do about that one.	game/mansion.rpy	4262	c "[what]"
trial2z_a6548ef2	h	Sorry? Ye think a pitiful apology like that will get you off me pirate hook?	game/mansion.rpy	4263	h "[what]"
trial2z_7df9d945	h	Ye could've not killed her!	game/mansion.rpy	4264	h "[what]"
trial2z_9fcbc761	c	Well uh... the Game Master kind of forced my hand.	game/mansion.rpy	4265	c "[what]"
trial2z_7e823f68	h	Ye could've killed someone else!	game/mansion.rpy	4266	h "[what]"
trial2z_199e7e51	b	Not a great alternative...	game/mansion.rpy	4267	b "[what]"
trial2z_ac2f74b9	bi	...	game/mansion.rpy	4268	bi "[what]"
trial2z_4d7ac514	b	Wait.	game/mansion.rpy	4269	b "[what]"
trial2z_92a464a9	b	Catherine, the Game Master isn't killing you yet.	game/mansion.rpy	4270	b "[what]"
trial2z_2e2b81b6	b	I know these are... well, your last moments but...	game/mansion.rpy	4271	b "[what]"
trial2z_bc3a4eda	b	Tell us as much as you can.	game/mansion.rpy	4272	b "[what]"
trial2z_3784857a	c	...?	game/mansion.rpy	4273	c "[what]"
trial2z_92adc00d	c	Oh!	game/mansion.rpy	4276	c "[what]"
trial2z_89aefe22	c	I see.	game/mansion.rpy	4277	c "[what]"
trial2z_bc36c180	c	Resourceful as always, Bert.	game/mansion.rpy	4278	c "[what]"
trial2z_1e2df1bc	c	Yeah, fire away!	game/mansion.rpy	4279	c "[what]"
trial2z_896ee809	bi	...Why isn't the Game Master just killing her?	game/mansion.rpy	4280	bi "[what]"
trial2z_9c46b85b	bi	Eh, that doesn't matter. Gotta use this opportunity while we can.	game/mansion.rpy	4281	bi "[what]"
trial2z_1f620da0	b	Ok, let's go quickly, we don't know how much time we have.	game/mansion.rpy	4282	b "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_5f0f79ce	b	What do you mean the Game Master forced your hand?	game/mansion.rpy	4292	b "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_b61d3179	c	The instructions I got telling me to kill someone said there was a deadline.	game/mansion.rpy	4293	c "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_57fd7c5e	c	They didn't say what the deadline was, but if the deadline arrived everyone would die.	game/mansion.rpy	4294	c "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_3801995e	c	So... I had to kill someone and hope I got lucky to try to save everyone.	game/mansion.rpy	4295	c "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_ed7edc40	h	I see... I guess it's hard to blame ye then.	game/mansion.rpy	4306	h "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_a8c2efef	h	I apologize for me outburst earlier lassie.	game/mansion.rpy	4307	h "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_ade0dc40	c	That's nice of you Shahar!	game/mansion.rpy	4308	c "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_052f7fe9	c	Oh, when I was given instructions by the Game Master, they gave me a key to the closet.	game/mansion.rpy	4318	c "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_dbd392aa	b	A key?	game/mansion.rpy	4319	b "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_920a9ba4	b	Hmm... I wonder if Kaiser had access to the train computer for the same reason.	game/mansion.rpy	4320	b "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_30d6c761	b	Before I thought maybe it was because he had been on the train before.	game/mansion.rpy	4321	b "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_75b2f4eb	d	If I may interject, I have a supposition.	game/mansion.rpy	4327	d "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_89034b44	d	What if the Game Master gives every murderer a location-based advantage?	game/mansion.rpy	4328	d "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_7543ea61	c	Huh?	game/mansion.rpy	4329	c "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_0214aa33	b	Hm... it makes sense. Both you and Kaiser got something tied to the location.	game/mansion.rpy	4330	b "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_40c776f2	d	And it "levels" the playing field in some sense.	game/mansion.rpy	4331	d "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_8ed0e2a1	b	I think you may be right... something we should look out for in the future.	game/mansion.rpy	4332	b "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_064d6514	c	Um... honestly, I just set the generator up and waited for it to get someone.	game/mansion.rpy	4341	c "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_850ef128	b	...	game/mansion.rpy	4342	b "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_e82130dc	b	...Did you have any idea who the Game Master was at least?	game/mansion.rpy	4343	b "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_0e750d6d	c	Nope!	game/mansion.rpy	4344	c "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_82cbc0a8	l	Wait... so Freddy could have died to this? You were okay with killing a kid?	game/mansion.rpy	4350	l "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_ea745fa0	c	I mean... I get it's easy to be angry at me, I had to kill somebody.	game/mansion.rpy	4353	c "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_f5bc3157	c	And it's "easier" if it's someone random.	game/mansion.rpy	4358	c "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_7e6521bf	c	Then I wouldn't feel like I chose to kill someone just because I didn't like them.	game/mansion.rpy	4359	c "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_bc2961a4	c	Oh well, I'm gonna die soon anyway. Maybe it'll be easier for you if you think I'm crazy!	game/mansion.rpy	4363	c "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_b520df92	c	Mwahahahaha, that's me, Catherine the kooky catgirl!	game/mansion.rpy	4364	c "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_82822a0c	l	...	game/mansion.rpy	4365	l "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_587cc6a1	l	I... don't know how to respond to that.	game/mansion.rpy	4366	l "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_820cf926	c	Good! Better that you're confused than angry.	game/mansion.rpy	4367	c "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_07b51653	c	Oh yeah, I burgled this mansion before while the owner was out.	game/mansion.rpy	4376	c "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_51f6deb3	b	You did know Mr. Sydell?	game/mansion.rpy	4377	b "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_3ef23c8e	c	Eh, never met the guy. I just overheard from an acquaintance that he was in court that day.	game/mansion.rpy	4378	c "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_9860f853	c	I waited around that day until his family left for other reasons and made my move.	game/mansion.rpy	4379	c "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_b4a92ff1	b	So... does that mean you lied to me earlier when I asked?	game/mansion.rpy	4380	b "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_0eff4f72	c	Yup! But c'mon, that's just one of many lies I told you, you won't hold that against me, right?	game/mansion.rpy	4381	c "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_850ef128_1	b	...	game/mansion.rpy	4382	b "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_05ad0b31	c	Well, I guess it's fine if you do, the Game Master's gonna fry my brain or something regardless.	game/mansion.rpy	4383	c "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_09a16e8a	b	No, I won't hold it against you, you had to do it I'm sure.	game/mansion.rpy	4384	b "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_6b7cdd08	c	Wait, I just remembered. Before you ask anything else, I have a request.	game/mansion.rpy	4387	c "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_a754659e	c	Bert, can you take care of Sesame? If he doesn't also get brain-zapped, that is.	game/mansion.rpy	4389	c "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_346920fb	b	Me?	game/mansion.rpy	4390	b "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_5b2c70a7	c	Yeah! You're the one who figured out I was the murderer, it's almost like you killed me.	game/mansion.rpy	4391	c "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_37f11808	c	To the victor goes the spoils, right?	game/mansion.rpy	4392	c "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_34f35742	h	Aye lassie, yer finally speaking me language!	game/mansion.rpy	4398	h "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_b7cb6179	b	Uh... I guess I'm honored?	game/mansion.rpy	4403	b "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_43700378	c	Well, if I'm being honest, I have selfish reasons too.	game/mansion.rpy	4404	c "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_85d0b677	c	I'm kind of mad at you for figuring it out.	game/mansion.rpy	4406	c "[what]"

cathGivesInfo_97b910ad	b	So uh, one last thing Catherine.	game/mansion.rpy	4417	b "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_8cb5efba	b	How did you receive the "instructions?"	game/mansion.rpy	4418	b "[what]"
cathGivesInfo_5c30e1f9	c	Well, when I woke up in the mansion it wasn't the first time.	game/mansion.rpy	4419	c "[what]"

cathGivesInfo_9e38b949	bi	I thought I had gotten to know Stella at least a little bit.	game/mansion.rpy	4441	bi "[what]"

mansSheath_25222c26	bi	So it's probably not relevant to the murder.	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	297	bi "[what]"

mansSheath_da543239	bi	But maybe someone found the sheath beforehand?	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	302	bi "[what]"

mansDracula_57c6c932	d	I was hoping someone would admit to a crime that could be tied to this location.	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	321	d "[what]"
mansDracula_c930c549	d	If so, they would probably be the murderer.	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	322	d "[what]"

mansDracula_13b425e3	bi	Back then, we concluded as a group the murderer this round is probably someone who's been in this house before.	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	324	bi "[what]"

mansGarage_958756fa	i	The clock, for one, and some batteries.	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	477	i "[what]"
mansGarage_0fc0a59f	b	Right, Catherine and Jenny were using the clock because the microwave and oven clocks broke.	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	478	b "[what]"
mansGarage_7ef74a2d	b	And Catherine asked Jenny to grab the batteries for the clock.	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	479	b "[what]"
mansGarage_4931db3e	i	The stepstool's gone too.	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	480	i "[what]"

mansGarage_8fe0f4d8	i	The generator's missing. Also some rope.	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	482	i "[what]"
mansGarage_0ea2fcdf	b	Right, I saw the generator and rope in Jenny's room earlier during the investigation.	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	484	b "[what]"
mansGarage_fd81a135	b	...Huh?	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	486	b "[what]"
mansGarage_e203184d	b	Where did those go?	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	487	b "[what]"
mansGarage_71201201	b	I guess I should work on finding them.	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	488	b "[what]"
mansGarage_052aadc5	i	Besides that, I think everything's here.	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	489	i "[what]"

mansGarage_672484e2	b	Okay, that was actually very useful.	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	494	b "[what]"
mansGarage_3c6ef3d2	b	Everything that was in the garage is accounted for, so we don't have to worry about any surprise tools.	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	496	b "[what]"

mansGarage_48d31fea	bi	I don't know, but...	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	501	bi "[what]"
mansGarage_c1e05124	b	Yeah Sid. I have some theories already, actually.	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	502	b "[what]"
mansGarage_f3e0795d	i	Oh. Okay, cool...	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	503	i "[what]"
mansGarageDoor_117a966c	b	Hm... maybe the murderer managed to open the garage door, went to a store, and bought a knife!	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	511	b "[what]"
mansGarageDoor_a6cdeb7a	i	That... seems unlikely.	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	513	i "[what]"

mansGenerator_951372f6	bi	It was in the garage earlier, and as far as I know nothing in the house lost power...	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	641	bi "[what]"
mansGenerator_111f10c3	bi	So someone must have moved it here for some other reason, right?	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	642	bi "[what]"
mansGenerator_76f3e97e	blank	Generator was added to evidence.	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	647	blank "[what]"
mansGenerator_53bc7cf4	bi	Also... what's up with this rope tied around the handle?	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	648	bi "[what]"
mansGenerator_ac2f74b9	bi	...	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	649	bi "[what]"
mansGenerator_6a03a719	bi	Oh, the generator has wheels.	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	650	bi "[what]"

mansNightstand_0afc2a7c	bi	It's empty, guess that makes sense.	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	764	bi "[what]"
mansNightstand_4503e77f	bi	Not like any of us have any spare clothes or anything to store.	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	765	bi "[what]"
mansNightstand_355d961f	bi	And it'd be a bit too simple to try to hide a murder weapon in here...	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	766	bi "[what]"

mansCatherine_74cf4922	b	Yeah?	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	795	b "[what]"
mansCatherine_b0813fe1	c	Turns out he's lying! He actually sleeps, he just waits until people around him are sleeping.	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	796	c "[what]"
mansCatherine_60f71356	c	And then he wakes up earlier than we do.	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	797	c "[what]"
mansCatherine_20ea6505	c	So if you don't wake up in the middle of the night, you can't tell if he was asleep or not!	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	798	c "[what]"
mansCatherine_13f4f5e8	c	But yesterday I woke up in the middle of night because Sesame was making noises...	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	799	c "[what]"
mansCatherine_6ded1869	c	And there was Dracula, sleeping on the floor!	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	800	c "[what]"
mansCatherine_a159fbf6	b	Huh...	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	801	b "[what]"

mansSink_de75d0b1	bi	Hm... I wonder if Stella made any progress stealing the sink handle before she died.	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	878	bi "[what]"
mansSink_4e80475a	bi	I doubt it'll lead to anything, but might as well look under there.	game/mansscreens-inv.rpy	879	bi "[what]"

shahHang_bd657fa2	h	I remember I'd order 'em around the ship, and they wouldn't do what I said.	game/shah-fte.rpy	222	h "[what]"

midcar3_28b62c95	n	Yeah, none of us could figure out the password. We can't do anything without it.	game/train.rpy	1088	n "[what]"
midcar3_e0e2a7f4	i	Well, I got to the file directory, but it wouldn't let me open anything up.	game/train.rpy	1089	i "[what]"
midcar3_33e68a75	n	What? You got to the file directory? How did you do that?	game/train.rpy	1090	n "[what]"
midcar3_4e276adc	i	I work with computers a lot when I'm helping my dad with the shop.	game/train.rpy	1091	i "[what]"

midcar3_62ccad76	i	So I typed in "DIR" and hit enter.	game/train.rpy	1097	i "[what]"

midcar3_da01fde0	i	I couldn't click on any of the files, I could only see names.	game/train.rpy	1100	i "[what]"
midcar3_b9edea88	i	I tried to make a mental note of all of them, but...	game/train.rpy	1101	i "[what]"
midcar3_2e0a5396	i	Only two of them really jumped out to me.	game/train.rpy	1106	i "[what]"
midcar3_225041a2	i	One called "Participants" and one called "Train Route".	game/train.rpy	1107	i "[what]"
midcar3_2f65785b	n	Wow... "Train Route" would almost definitely be useful.	game/train.rpy	1111	n "[what]"
midcar3_d481298f	i	I'm positive that it would tell us where the train is going, if we could open it.	game/train.rpy	1112	i "[what]"
midcar3_60ea3b14	i	We could figure out how much time we have.	game/train.rpy	1113	i "[what]"
midcar3_d2b71f32	i	If we have time, the murderer could give us time to find a way out if they're feeling nice!	game/train.rpy	1114	i "[what]"
midcar3_3a3ea18d	ni	And... "participants". I wonder if that's about... us.	game/train.rpy	1117	ni "[what]"
midcar3_1d5875f3	ni	If it is, maybe that file could tell us why we're all here...	game/train.rpy	1118	ni "[what]"
midcar3_615f9927	ni	Maybe the Game Master's not in the file. If so, it would tell us who's behind all this.	game/train.rpy	1119	ni "[what]"
midcar3_004fef12	ni	If I could find them... I could kill them... and end this mess.	game/train.rpy	1120	ni "[what]"
midcar3_e6bc84f4	ni	After all, the screen never said people who weren't chosen couldn't murder people.	game/train.rpy	1121	ni "[what]"
midcar3_3fcf734b	ni	If I know I'm innocent, why shouldn't I try to kill someone to maximize my chances of surviving?	game/train.rpy	1122	ni "[what]"
midcar3_defc95be	i	That's not all, though!	game/train.rpy	1124	i "[what]"
midcar3_f82d5aff	i	Afterwards, I noticed something else when I hit Return...	game/train.rpy	1125	i "[what]"
midcar3_1adcb46c	i	The users went up from 0 to 1.	game/train.rpy	1127	i "[what]"
midcar3_bdf07152	n	Wait, so the user counter isn't tracking how many people are currently logged in...	game/train.rpy	1128	n "[what]"
midcar3_cb1f55b5	n	It's tracking how many people have checked the file directory {i}total?{/i}	game/train.rpy	1129	n "[what]"
midcar3_f6d5c32a	i	It seems like it.	game/train.rpy	1130	i "[what]"
midcar3_07af5121	n	So we'll know if someone else gets this info from the computer.	game/train.rpy	1132	n "[what]"
midcar3_27e51c50	n	Do you think the counter will go up if someone logs in with the password?	game/train.rpy	1133	n "[what]"
midcar3_7889405d	i	If someone logs in, they can probably reset or change the counter using "user_counter.exe".	game/train.rpy	1134	i "[what]"
midcar3_a049bab2	i	So that might not be reliable...	game/train.rpy	1135	i "[what]"
midcar3_8012ecba	n	Got it.	game/train.rpy	1136	n "[what]"
midcar3_df336d9f	n	Either way, Sid, this is a huge find!	game/train.rpy	1138	n "[what]"
midcar3_aea9720e	i	Haha, really, it's nothing...	game/train.rpy	1141	i "[what]"
midcar3_d729e10d	n	Let's keep this between you and me for now.	game/train.rpy	1142	n "[what]"
midcar3_76634887	n	This might come in handy, but I don't think we should share it with everyone just yet.	game/train.rpy	1143	n "[what]"
midcar3_43352325	i	Yeah... I don't trust some of these people.	game/train.rpy	1146	i "[what]"
midcar3_329baace	i	The pirate guy and the vampire guy scare me, and that French lady is such a drunk hag.	game/train.rpy	1148	i "[what]"
midcar3_1155742b	i	I think the pirate and vampire are hiding something.	game/train.rpy	1149	i "[what]"
midcar3_901a1091	i	And the rich lady would have tons of money, enough to hire people to kidnap all of us.	game/train.rpy	1150	i "[what]"
midcar3_10270461	ni	Hm...	game/train.rpy	1151	ni "[what]"
midcar3_78f11888	ni	There's no chance a Game Master would reveal this kind of information to me, right?	game/train.rpy	1152	ni "[what]"
midcar3_4b118370	ni	Building trust with someone gives me one less candidate to murder, if nothing else.	game/train.rpy	1153	ni "[what]"
midcar3_0deacb0c	n	I'm with you. Let's stick together Sid.	game/train.rpy	1154	n "[what]"

midcar3_4744bcee	n	We found all three light switches in the front car earlier.	game/train.rpy	1161	n "[what]"

midcar3_5850d105	n	Yeah, let's hit the hay. We can figure out some more plans in the morning.	game/train.rpy	1163	n "[what]"
midcar3_3f78a7c0	i	You can have the bed. I'm fine sleeping on the bench.	game/train.rpy	1164	i "[what]"
midcar3_b98129b9	n	Okay, you can have the bed tomorrow night.	game/train.rpy	1165	n "[what]"
midcar3_f6226f42	ni	Damn... the thought of still being on this train tomorrow night is...	game/train.rpy	1166	ni "[what]"

trial1a_bcdd4731	c	Yeah, so for a few minutes, this car had to have been completely empty.	game/train.rpy	2235	c "[what]"
trial1a_89b9c2b9	b	Well, Sid could have come into this car while everyone was up front, and we would have no way of knowing.	game/train.rpy	2237	b "[what]"
trial1a_bae489ab	b	But aside from that, yes.	game/train.rpy	2238	b "[what]"
trial1a_215828cb	s	I don't think there's any time trickery going on here, it seems pretty clear-cut.	game/train.rpy	2239	s "[what]"
trial1a_cf6d9090	j	I think we should talk about alibis.	game/train.rpy	2243	j "[what]"
trial1a_0bb9ed54	j	That's what they do in all the crime shows, at least.	game/train.rpy	2244	j "[what]"
trial1a_0c43b83e	c	Haha! I love those shows.	game/train.rpy	2246	c "[what]"
trial1a_9a7a98a4	c	Oops. Dammit Catherine, now's not the time to fangirl.	game/train.rpy	2248	c "[what]"
trial1a_558d7a83	j	Anyway... who here can vouch, with certainty, about where someone else was during the darkness?	game/train.rpy	2249	j "[what]"
trial1a_7706f0da	j	It's important to figure out exactly where everyone was.	game/train.rpy	2250	j "[what]"
trial1a_007e0077	j	Freddy and I, for example, were holding hands the whole time.	game/train.rpy	2251	j "[what]"
trial1a_f2cb2d15	j	In fact, I think Bert even saw us holding hands before it got dark.	game/train.rpy	2252	j "[what]"
trial1a_c78b7625	f	Yeah! We wanted Bert to play with us.	game/train.rpy	2256	f "[what]"
trial1a_12836285	f	We didn't g-get to play though...	game/train.rpy	2257	f "[what]"
trial1a_93f5425f	b	Yeah, it is true. They definitely came up to me together before it all happened.	game/train.rpy	2258	b "[what]"
trial1a_72633d6c	b	I don't think they had even moved a foot once I could see them again.	game/train.rpy	2259	b "[what]"
trial1a_f41713a4	j	I'd like to say that we can vouch for where Bert was too, but...	game/train.rpy	2260	j "[what]"
trial1a_ea29ed74	b	No, you can't. For all you know I could have been anywhere, and just went back to the same spot.	game/train.rpy	2261	b "[what]"
trial1a_984f6b91	j	...Yeah.	game/train.rpy	2267	j "[what]"
trial1a_730bcf4d	b	So Jenny and Freddy should be cleared with alibis.	game/train.rpy	2268	b "[what]"
trial1a_9eaff1ea	b	As well as Lauren, Kaiser, Sam, and Shahar.	game/train.rpy	2270	b "[what]"
trial1a_318eae17	c	Sesame was my alibi!	game/train.rpy	2276	c "[what]"
trial1a_22f4bc51	ses	Mrewew!	game/train.rpy	2277	ses "[what]"
trial1a_52eba159	i	Does that count?	game/train.rpy	2280	i "[what]"
trial1a_9e527e49	b	Not exactly... 	game/train.rpy	2281	b "[what]"
trial1a_646a748b	i	So it could have been Catherine?	game/train.rpy	2283	i "[what]"
trial1a_31d00094	i	She could have snuck into the back car and done it!	game/train.rpy	2284	i "[what]"
trial1a_983020b1	i	I told you it wasn't me!	game/train.rpy	2285	i "[what]"
trial1a_9d0e7e8a	t	You're not the fastest learner Sid.	game/train.rpy	2294	t "[what]"
trial1a_076901f3	b	Hey wait, slow down!	game/train.rpy	2295	b "[what]"
trial1a_cf690152	t	I suppose you are just a child... Think more clearly.	game/train.rpy	2296	t "[what]"
trial1a_35b68067	tut	You're about to take part in your first debate.	game/train.rpy	2298	tut "[what]"
trial1a_accb7ef9	tut	Four statements will appear. Statements with blue text can be agreed with.	game/train.rpy	2299	tut "[what]"
trial1a_26089d01	tut	To agree with a statement, click on it then press "Agree".	game/train.rpy	2300	tut "[what]"
trial1a_9710d63d	tut	Statements with red text can be refuted using evidence.	game/train.rpy	2301	tut "[what]"
trial1a_90173e58	tut	To refute a statement, click on it, then press "Refute", then select evidence.	game/train.rpy	2302	tut "[what]"
trial1a_6e3d8f5e	tut	Find the correct or incorrect statement and its refutation to proceed.	game/train.rpy	2303	tut "[what]"
trial1a_9daffe48	tut	There is no penalty for choosing the wrong statement or evidence, except shame upon your family.	game/train.rpy	2304	tut "[what]"
trial1a_968026b6	tut	Good luck!	game/train.rpy	2305	tut "[what]"
trial1b_9e4553a6	b	Yeah, that's it!	game/train.rpy	2323	b "[what]"
trial1b_b611a64a	b	Hey! Catherine couldn't have left the bar car.	game/train.rpy	2330	b "[what]"
trial1b_e6b1a7de	b	She knew about the scream!	game/train.rpy	2331	b "[what]"
trial1b_ced18b81	t	Hmmm... and neither Sid nor those in the front car heard the scream...	game/train.rpy	2332	t "[what]"
trial1b_f076d1bf	t	So if she left the bar car, how could she have known?	game/train.rpy	2333	t "[what]"
trial1b_fcf59b88	b	Exactly!	game/train.rpy	2334	b "[what]"
trial1b_f3f9a474	b	We can't prove exactly what she was doing, but it seems pretty clear she didn't leave this car.	game/train.rpy	2335	b "[what]"
trial1b_612f1103	bi	Unless of course, she was the one that caused the scream...	game/train.rpy	2338	bi "[what]"
trial1b_6614b8e7	bi	Then she would know about it even if she did leave this train car.	game/train.rpy	2339	bi "[what]"
trial1b_49ffd0e1	bi	Best to keep that in mind.	game/train.rpy	2340	bi "[what]"
trial1b_0c2952c8	i	I-I... agree. I guess.	game/train.rpy	2342	i "[what]"
trial1b_f8f5f970	i	I just don't want to be the only suspect...	game/train.rpy	2347	i "[what]"
trial1b_d3b18bfb	i	I r-really didn't do it.	game/train.rpy	2348	i "[what]"
trial1b_b652f7ec	o	Well... If anything, that just made it seem even more like Sid did it.	game/train.rpy	2354	o "[what]"
trial1b_3a5947b5	o	It's hard to come to terms with that though, he is just a kid...	game/train.rpy	2355	o "[what]"
trial1b_793fca57	o	Maybe we should pivot toward a different topic.	game/train.rpy	2356	o "[what]"
trial1b_bd143d48	b	Yeah, there's a lot to talk about.	game/train.rpy	2357	b "[what]"
trial1b_e71d17bb	j	Yeah. Let's talk about the uh, stabby stick.	game/train.rpy	2362	j "[what]"
trial1b_36a6b681	o	The stabby stick?	game/train.rpy	2368	o "[what]"
trial1b_a5838c6e	j	The murder pole! Whatever we're calling it.	game/train.rpy	2369	j "[what]"
trial1b_b3b713e8	b	The murder weapon?	game/train.rpy	2370	b "[what]"
trial1b_e20bdccc	j	Yeah, what is that thing? And where did it come from?	game/train.rpy	2371	j "[what]"
trial1b_1da167f3	b	It seems to be a pretty ordinary metal pole with a sharp end to it.	game/train.rpy	2372	b "[what]"
trial1b_4958deaa	b	I don't know what it's doing on the train though.	game/train.rpy	2373	b "[what]"
trial1b_8308c51a	o	And Jenny made a good point - where did it come from?	game/train.rpy	2374	o "[what]"
trial1b_74ea4d53	o	I thought we had all searched the train, at least a little bit.	game/train.rpy	2375	o "[what]"
trial1b_0707f1a6	o	Does anybody remember seeing it?	game/train.rpy	2376	o "[what]"
trial1b_daf9335f	blank	Nobody spoke up.	game/train.rpy	2380	blank "[what]"
trial1b_4b913863	bi	Nobody saw it?	game/train.rpy	2383	bi "[what]"
trial1b_d838f979	bi	Unfortunately, that can't be true.	game/train.rpy	2384	bi "[what]"
trial1b_deedcdb4	bi	Someone here used it to kill Dan. Where was it hiding?	game/train.rpy	2385	bi "[what]"
trial1b_fb64f884	bi	I thought I had checked everywhere... but maybe there is one place I hadn't looked.	game/train.rpy	2386	bi "[what]"
trial1c_511384e7	b	That's it!	game/train.rpy	2401	b "[what]"
trial1c_5003701b	b	It had to have been in the caboose closet.	game/train.rpy	2402	b "[what]"
trial1c_ed71ff68	s	Hm? That closet was locked.	game/train.rpy	2406	s "[what]"
trial1c_3be07ba1	s	Dracula checked it when we first explored the back car.	game/train.rpy	2407	s "[what]"
trial1c_435503b7	j	He mentioned that to me too.	game/train.rpy	2408	j "[what]"
trial1c_02389640	b	But did anyone other than Dracula actually check the closet?	game/train.rpy	2409	b "[what]"
trial1c_b8d712c7	j	Hmm, I didn't.	game/train.rpy	2410	j "[what]"
trial1c_72cf6d64	j	The bed was pushed up against it anyway, it would be annoying move the bed and fully open the door.	game/train.rpy	2411	j "[what]"
trial1c_c1d0e85b	j	I took his word for it being locked.	game/train.rpy	2412	j "[what]"
trial1c_a64a564a	s	Hey, what the hell? Was Dracula lying about the closet being locked?	game/train.rpy	2413	s "[what]"
trial1c_2931d2db	d	This is an unfortunate situation...	game/train.rpy	2417	d "[what]"
trial1c_e557f981	d	I was hoping this wouldn't wind up being relevant...	game/train.rpy	2423	d "[what]"
trial1c_656e546f	s	What are you talking about?	game/train.rpy	2424	s "[what]"
trial1c_ba39cba1	d	Truth be told, I was the first one to wake up on the train.	game/train.rpy	2427	d "[what]"
trial1c_6799bbdb	d	I noticed everyone else was still unconscious, so I did a little exploring.	game/train.rpy	2428	d "[what]"
trial1c_814c11ec	d	That's when I noticed the, as the girl says, 'stabby stick' in the closet.	game/train.rpy	2429	d "[what]"
trial1c_2f8a7962	s	Are you kidding me?! So it was unlocked?	game/train.rpy	2430	s "[what]"
trial1c_aacda4f9	d	Yes, the closet was unlocked the whole time.	game/train.rpy	2431	d "[what]"
trial1c_fe11113d	d	When I saw the metal bar, I was worried about it becoming a weapon.	game/train.rpy	2432	d "[what]"
trial1c_af2d77d9	d	However, I couldn't find anywhere better to hide it. So instead, I made sure to disuade people from opening the closet.	game/train.rpy	2433	d "[what]"
trial1c_b3cae84e	k	And we're to simply believe that?	game/train.rpy	2437	k "[what]"
trial1c_f378bda3	d	Well, {i}did{/i} anybody else check the closet to see if it really was locked?	game/train.rpy	2438	d "[what]"
trial1c_daf9335f	blank	Nobody spoke up.	game/train.rpy	2442	blank "[what]"
trial1c_82091822	k	...	game/train.rpy	2443	k "[what]"
trial1c_9506d621	d	Hmph. As I thought.	game/train.rpy	2447	d "[what]"
trial1c_9c59ba3e	b	So unless Dan himself found the murder weapon, it seems like the murderer themself was the only one who could have.	game/train.rpy	2448	b "[what]"
trial1c_b5bbd5df	b	...This is progress...!	game/train.rpy	2450	b "[what]"
trial1c_a583029b	b	Now we just need to figure out who went into the closet!	game/train.rpy	2451	b "[what]"
trial1c_850ef128	b	...	game/train.rpy	2452	b "[what]"
trial1c_e08e6bad	bi	That might be easier said than done. It feels like it could have been anyone.	game/train.rpy	2453	bi "[what]"
trial1c_2ad10c6e	k	Well, if we're accepting this reality... it once again seems Sid is the obvious answer.	game/train.rpy	2454	k "[what]"
trial1c_99cb0a27	k	Sid and Dan were sleeping in the back car every night.	game/train.rpy	2455	k "[what]"
trial1c_5e1d712a	k	Sid should have had access to the weapon quite easily.	game/train.rpy	2456	k "[what]"
trial1c_8db5a057	k	In fact, he could have just done it while Dan was sleeping, and staged the scene afterwards.	game/train.rpy	2457	k "[what]"
trial1c_f59b92b7	d	Yes, I do agree.	game/train.rpy	2458	d "[what]"
trial1c_ef5709c8	d	The evidence seems quite damning, once again.	game/train.rpy	2459	d "[what]"
trial1c_d48884ea	i	Wait, no way!	game/train.rpy	2463	i "[what]"
trial1c_19a5de0d	i	Even i-if I wanted to, I couldn't have gotten into the closet!	game/train.rpy	2464	i "[what]"
trial1c_d21b9585	k	Why's that?	game/train.rpy	2465	k "[what]"
trial1c_d14ea37e	i	Dan! Dan was sleeping in the cot last night, and the cot blocks the closet!	game/train.rpy	2466	i "[what]"
trial1c_67e2d63b	i	It won't even open if you don't move the cot a little!	game/train.rpy	2467	i "[what]"
trial1c_6d9c4c45	d	This is true.	game/train.rpy	2472	d "[what]"
trial1c_2962db5c	t	Oh my, this is starting to get interesting!	game/train.rpy	2477	t "[what]"
trial1c_1a09e21e	t	So you two weren't sharing the cot?	game/train.rpy	2478	t "[what]"
trial1c_503fb533	i	I - what? No, of course not! I slept on the bench.	game/train.rpy	2479	i "[what]"
trial1c_5a23289c	b	Stella...	game/train.rpy	2480	b "[what]"
trial1c_548e12be	t	Hehe, I kid darling.	game/train.rpy	2481	t "[what]"
trial1c_64d0e164	t	Regardless...	game/train.rpy	2482	t "[what]"
trial1c_d414907c	t	I'm not entirely sure your defense would hold up in court.	game/train.rpy	2486	t "[what]"
trial1c_0a8ea818	t	How do we know you slept on the bench and not the cot?	game/train.rpy	2487	t "[what]"
trial1c_8eb99369	t	Then you'd be able to grab the weapon while Dan was sleeping, no problem.	game/train.rpy	2488	t "[what]"
trial1c_2909bb43	i	Well, 	game/train.rpy	2489	i "[what]"
trial1c_42b3a2c8	extend	I don't know, I guess...	game/train.rpy	2490	extend "[what]"
trial1c_2a11602a	i	I guess I can't prove it.	game/train.rpy	2491	i "[what]"
trial1c_f4487580	bi	Hmmm... proof that Dan slept on the cot, and Sid slept on the bench.	game/train.rpy	2497	bi "[what]"
trial1c_2937c534	bi	Who might have that?	game/train.rpy	2498	bi "[what]"
trial1d_6d62fcdf	c	Huh? Me?	game/train.rpy	2508	c "[what]"
trial1d_bb00a52c	c	What do you mean?	game/train.rpy	2509	c "[what]"
trial1d_40bcfb42	b	Remember back to your conversation with Dan and Sid this morning?	game/train.rpy	2510	b "[what]"
trial1d_4ce77e5e	c	Hm?	game/train.rpy	2511	c "[what]"
trial1d_6ca6d671	c	Oh! You're right!	game/train.rpy	2512	c "[what]"
trial1d_50985006	c	I completely forgot about getting mad at Dan this morning.	game/train.rpy	2515	c "[what]"
trial1d_074714b6	c	Sorry Dan!	game/train.rpy	2516	c "[what]"
trial1d_8f02d3f3	bi	He's still dead.	game/train.rpy	2517	bi "[what]"
trial1d_3dfb0ca3	c	Anyway, you're totally right! Sid mentioned that his back hurt from sleeping on the bench.	game/train.rpy	2518	c "[what]"
trial1d_9e4553a6	b	Yeah, that's it!	game/train.rpy	2519	b "[what]"
trial1d_227a26ea	b	If Sid was planning on murdering Dan, it'd make sense for him to lie.	game/train.rpy	2520	b "[what]"
trial1d_f37f0f71	b	But Dan agreed and said he slept on the cot, so it seems like we have proof.	game/train.rpy	2521	b "[what]"
trial1d_37049a21	c	So it seems like it wasn't Sid... at least not while Dan was sleeping.	game/train.rpy	2522	c "[what]"
trial1d_7329c186	i	Yeah! And and and...	game/train.rpy	2527	i "[what]"
trial1d_4c5a3e45	i	I spent almost all my free time up in the front car trying to get into the computer.	game/train.rpy	2528	i "[what]"
trial1d_1b5362a0	i	I was never alone in the back car, I swear!	game/train.rpy	2529	i "[what]"
trial1d_0ec0b28b	b	Can anyone prove otherwise?	game/train.rpy	2530	b "[what]"
trial1d_daf9335f	blank	Nobody spoke up.	game/train.rpy	2531	blank "[what]"
trial1d_4ca05b19	i	Does... does that finally prove I'm innocent?	game/train.rpy	2532	i "[what]"
trial1d_d8a6232d	s	More than anything, it shows we're not getting anywhere.	game/train.rpy	2536	s "[what]"
trial1d_2609958c	s	You were basically our only lead.	game/train.rpy	2537	s "[what]"
trial1d_7dcd3b29	s	I mean, you were literally right next to him when he died.	game/train.rpy	2538	s "[what]"
trial1d_8d735c23	s	If it wasn't you, who the hell was it?	game/train.rpy	2539	s "[what]"
trial1d_3041c62a	b	Hey! We're getting somewhere. We've learned about a lot of our alibis, and about the murder weapon.	game/train.rpy	2540	b "[what]"
trial1d_3563c2db	s	Where do we even go from here?	game/train.rpy	2541	s "[what]"
trial1d_e1ecfff4	s	What are we supposed to do?	game/train.rpy	2542	s "[what]"
trial1d_ea4d0133	t	Weren't you paying attention Sam? No?	game/train.rpy	2546	t "[what]"
trial1d_8114347c	t	There are a few more things to figure out.	game/train.rpy	2547	t "[what]"
trial1d_3e8bfd31	t	For example - those of us who were in this car - Catherine, Bert, Jenny, Freddy, and myself.	game/train.rpy	2548	t "[what]"
trial1d_1d783709	t	Recall the loud scream we heard.	game/train.rpy	2549	t "[what]"
trial1d_10402f64	bi	...!	game/train.rpy	2550	bi "[what]"
trial1d_4724ffa8	t	Who was that? There's no mistaking that it happened.	game/train.rpy	2551	t "[what]"
trial1d_f9a75ef6	b	You're right - I heard it too.	game/train.rpy	2552	b "[what]"
trial1d_a981115e	s	What are you on about? Who cares if someone screamed?	game/train.rpy	2553	s "[what]"
trial1d_eb86e2bf	s	Dan got stabbed through the chest, of course people are going to be screaming.	game/train.rpy	2554	s "[what]"
trial1d_784d8df1	t	Hmmm, with all due respect - which isn't much - you don't know what you're talking about.	game/train.rpy	2555	t "[what]"
trial1d_6cce8c90	s	What did you just say to me?	game/train.rpy	2562	s "[what]"
trial1d_718bcdda	t	Oh? Did that get you all riled up? Haha!	game/train.rpy	2566	t "[what]"
trial1d_ee59b460	bi	I need to step in... I know the answer!	game/train.rpy	2570	bi "[what]"
trial1e_4396e424	b	Hey, look!	game/train.rpy	2592	b "[what]"
trial1e_418c71c3	b	Believe it or not, Stella has a point. That scream was different.	game/train.rpy	2593	b "[what]"
trial1e_70ace94c	b	And we have a testimonial to back it up.	game/train.rpy	2594	b "[what]"
trial1e_30a5d4f6	d	I'd hardly call it a testimonial, but yes, I do agree with Stella.	game/train.rpy	2598	d "[what]"
trial1e_d202cdc8	d	I find it quite easy to focus in the dark, and to me, that scream felt very particular.	game/train.rpy	2599	d "[what]"
trial1e_3c9e564c	b	And what do you mean by that?	game/train.rpy	2600	b "[what]"
trial1e_140b4e2a	t	Ooooooo, can I be the one to explain it? I think I figured it out.	game/train.rpy	2603	t "[what]"
trial1e_2eb7d48e	d	If you insist.	game/train.rpy	2604	d "[what]"
trial1e_7f0d211a	t	It wasn't really someone screaming, it was a recording.	game/train.rpy	2606	t "[what]"
trial1e_ea2909f9	b	What? What do you mean?	game/train.rpy	2607	b "[what]"
trial1e_9f290e7b	d	Yes, this is the same conclusion I reached.	game/train.rpy	2608	d "[what]"
trial1e_319e77fb	b	How do you know?	game/train.rpy	2609	b "[what]"

trial1o_1cb3987b	k	It seems the first half of our investigation was in vain.	game/train.rpy	3457	k "[what]"
